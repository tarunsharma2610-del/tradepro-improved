# Phase 4 Progress

- Repository: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only.
- Branch: `phase4/roadmap-progress-checkpoints`.
- Starting commit: `9add7f98ccf89f0c146e4367b79cdd5877104ff3`.
- Starting Phase 3 CI: [Backend CI #40885193019](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40885193019) — reported successful in the handover context.
- Current Phase 4 status: **Planning/checkpoint scaffolding only. Audit not yet performed; no Phase 4 feature implementation claimed.**

## Completed in this checkpoint
- [x] Created dedicated Phase 4 branch `phase4/roadmap-progress-checkpoints` from the specified Phase 3 checkpoint commit.
- [x] Wrote Phase 4 roadmap and progress/checkpoint records.
- [ ] Run an exact-head CI on the new Phase 4 documentation commit(s).
- [ ] Verify the latest branch head and CI status after documentation updates.
- [x] Perform P4-0 static baseline audit and publish `PHASE4_P0_BASELINE_AUDIT.md`.
- [x] Implement fail-closed `TRADING_MODE=PAPER` validation in `backend/app/core/config.py`.
- [x] Add `backend/tests/test_trading_mode_safety.py` for PAPER normalization and LIVE/invalid-mode rejection.
- [ ] Obtain backend CI on the exact final Phase 4 head; no green status claimed yet.
- [ ] Continue P4-0B broker-write boundary call-path audit after CI.

## Work packages
- P4-0 baseline/audit: STATIC AUDIT DONE; safety config hardening committed, CI pending.
- P4-1 risk and paper execution safety: NOT STARTED; audit before deciding what is missing.
- P4-2 paper lifecycle/accounting integration: NOT STARTED; preserve Phase 3 invariants.
- P4-3 persistence/security/observability: NOT STARTED.
- P4-4 Upstox read-only integration readiness: NOT STARTED.
- P4-5 CI/docs/checkpoint: IN PROGRESS; exact-head CI pending.

## Non-negotiable safeguards
- Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; never modify `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- Do not update `main` or merge PR #6 / PR #7; keep Draft PRs unmerged absent explicit authorization.
- PAPER mode mandatory. Live broker order writes (`place_order`, `modify_order`, `cancel_order`) remain disabled.
- Do not promote brokerage estimates or aggregate post-trade API results into per-fill actual charges.
- Keep unsupported or unverified tariff scopes estimate-only/fail-closed for actual accounting.
- Production OAuth smoke tests and real Oracle restore remain deferred until deployment and authorized credentials/backups exist.

## Resume protocol
At the start of each continuation: verify the branch head, read this file and `PHASE4_LATEST_CI_CHECKPOINT.md`, inspect exact-head CI, then continue at the first unchecked item. Never infer success from a prior commit's CI. If CI fails, fix the failure and rerun before checkpointing green.
