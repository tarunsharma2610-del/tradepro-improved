# Phase 4 Latest CI Checkpoint

## Current checkpoint state
- Repository: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only.
- Branch: `phase4/roadmap-progress-checkpoints`.
- Base commit: `9add7f98ccf89f0c146e4367b79cdd5877104ff3`.
- Base Phase 3 workflow: [Backend CI #40885193019](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40885193019) — reported successful for the Phase 3 checkpoint.
- Phase 4 documentation commit: pending final result.
- Exact-head CI for Phase 4 documentation: **PENDING VERIFICATION**. Do not call this new checkpoint green until a run for the exact resulting head is confirmed.

## Scope of this checkpoint
This checkpoint creates Phase 4 planning/resume records only. It does not claim that the repository audit, deployment, OAuth smoke test, production Oracle backup/restore, or Phase 4 implementation has been completed.

## Next required actions
1. Verify the new branch's latest commit and the CI workflow triggered by the documentation commits.
2. If the workflow is running, wait/check the exact run. If failed, inspect job logs, fix on this Phase 4 branch, and rerun.
3. Once green, record exact commit SHA, run URL/ID, job outcomes, and any warnings here and in `PROGRESS.md` / `HANDOVER.md`.
4. Perform P4-0 audit from the latest green checkpoint; publish the gap matrix before implementation.

## Safety checklist
- [x] Only the `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` repository is in scope.
- [x] Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is out of scope.
- [x] No `main` update or PR merge authorized/performed by this checkpoint.
- [x] PAPER mode remains mandatory; live broker writes remain disabled.
- [x] Upstox brokerage API is estimate-only; post-trade charge API is aggregate reconciliation-only.
- [x] PR #6 and PR #7 must remain Draft/unmerged unless explicitly authorized.
- [ ] Exact-head Phase 4 documentation CI verified green.
