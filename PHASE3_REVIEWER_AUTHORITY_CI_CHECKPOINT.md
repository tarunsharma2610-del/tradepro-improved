## Authoritative Phase 3 checkpoint — 26 October 2026 (latest verified CI)

- Target repository only: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; branch `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`; implementation/test head `44830ec48b50b4f470ec9ca95dd2d3f4339dd3df`. Do not modify original `Tradepro`.
- Exact-head Backend CI: [run #40294178677 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40294178677), including the test separating NSE/IPFT arithmetic reconciliation from GST taxable-base approval.
- GST estimate helper accepts exactly 18%; tests reject 0%, 5%, 100%, and 100.01%. Rate guard does not approve taxable-base composition; component inclusion needs reviewer and invoice/source evidence.
- ₹307/crore versus ₹306.99/crore transaction charge + ₹0.01/crore IPFT is arithmetic reconciliation only, not GST-base approval.
- Canonical live-fill integration is verified: six independently verified charge snapshots, evidence revalidated under lock, no raw-only fallback; brokerage cap applied once before deterministic paise-exact allocation.
- Remaining Phase 3 gates: effective-dated tariff applicability; component-specific per-fill allocation acceptance; invoice/source-backed GST/IPFT and product/segment evidence; adversarial/migration/recovery review; final exact-head docs/sign-off.
- Upstox public schedules/calculator are estimates; aggregate charges endpoint is not actual per-fill evidence. Null remains unknown, not zero. Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle recovery.
- PAPER mandatory; live broker writes, automatic live-fill promotion and automatic scheduling disabled. PR #6 open/draft/unmerged unless explicitly approved. Defer AI/open-source adaptations until Phase 3 acceptance. Documentation commit needs its own CI.

# Phase 3 reviewer-authority fix and exact-head CI — 24 October 2026

## Scope and safety
- Repository: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.
- PR #6 remains open, draft, and unmerged.
- Live broker order submission remains disabled.
- Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is out of scope and must remain untouched.

## Reviewer-authority follow-up
- Code commit: [`f0499bc50f513369ff166239e3a1d588f008ebbd`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/f0499bc50f513369ff166239e3a1d588f008ebbd).
- Regression test commit: [`c707d9ad53b4906bea9a376a4fcf9a8f74629a50`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/c707d9ad53b4906bea9a376a4fcf9a8f74629a50).
- Live-fill accounting now revalidates that the recorded source reviewer is an active platform administrator at promotion time. The reviewer row is locked after evidence/component/allocation locks to preserve lock order.
- Regression tests cover reviewer administrator-role revocation and account deactivation; rejected promotion must not create a live execution or live position and must leave the paper position unchanged.

## Exact-head CI
- Backend workflow run [`40089715163`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40089715163) for the regression-test commit completed successfully.
- Verified successful steps: dependency installation, backend pytest, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence-artifact retention.
- The separate code-commit run [`40089713242`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40089713242) also completed successfully.
- The workflow jobs passed; this does not independently prove production financial correctness, authentic broker issuance of uploaded documents, or recovery of a real Oracle Cloud deployment.

## Remaining acceptance gates
1. Explicitly establish fault-injection rollback coverage at each important accounting write/savepoint boundary.
2. Add/confirm a full concurrent live-fill promotion race test, separate from source-verification-versus-allocation-promotion concurrency.
3. Keep the reviewer-authority policy documented: current active-admin status is required at promotion time.
4. Synchronize project progress/handover/roadmap records with this follow-up and rerun CI on the final documentation head.
5. Do not merge PR #6 until accounting acceptance review is explicitly closed.

## Decision
The reviewer-authority code and regression tests pass CI. Phase 3 accounting acceptance remains open because the remaining rollback and concurrent live-fill promotion gates are not yet closed.


## 2026-10-24 — Resolver acceptance and CI checkpoint

- Backend workflow `40108183667` succeeded on prior head `8214430f562f6f425cfc1b9b6a6b3b547832b68a`. New resolver tests add exact broker/endpoint/schema/field/scope matching and non-finite-number rejection; newer commits still require CI.
- Mapping identity fixtures use immutable dataclass replacement. Intended-use semantics remain explicit; missing/null/invalid values remain unusable and retain provenance; numeric zero remains distinct.
- Accounting acceptance includes replay/conflict, ledger reconciliation, lock order, rollback, reviewer authority and PostgreSQL verification/promotion race coverage. Re-check exact test and workflow status before claiming complete. CI does not establish production tariff correctness or broker-origin authenticity.
- Safety gates unchanged: PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs unapproved. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Resolver field-identity guard added; CI pending

- Resolver now checks that the payload field name matches the terminal field in the selected approved mapping path. This closes a semantic mismatch where a caller could select `charges.ipft` but normalize another payload field.
- Implementation commit: `77aa77aec37dc535c3e427ca3f88c2ccb5e75ed8`; regression test commit: `5c5482c7f7fa623707698f64b6a061351e5e5b87`. CI for the latest commits is pending; previous green runs apply only to earlier heads.
- Existing accounting tests cover lock ordering, replay idempotency, conflicting evidence and rollback. A genuine concurrent two-session verification-versus-promotion race is not demonstrated in the inspected live-fill test file; locate/verify other integration coverage before marking complete.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs remain unapproved. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Latest resolver CI verified; PostgreSQL race coverage located

- Latest PR head `ed346e823cbfae8448fae0134c4ff864bfcc60ac` passed Backend workflow [#40109041654](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40109041654). This verifies the field-identity guard and regression test at that head.
- Located PostgreSQL-only integration tests in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`, including concurrent source verification vs allocation promotion and live-fill promotion vs ledger verification, as well as conflicting fill-set and tariff estimate/variance persistence races.
- These tests require `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`. Verify the PostgreSQL workflow actually ran these tests rather than skipped them before treating concurrency acceptance as complete.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs remain unapproved. Work only in `tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Upstox brokerage calculator restricted to estimates; CI pending

- Official Upstox `GET /v2/charges/brokerage` calculates charges from proposed order inputs; it is not proof of final booked per-fill charges. https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/
- Resolver blocks this endpoint from `PER_FILL_ACTUAL` and actual `AGGREGATE_SUMMARY` use, even if a mapping is misleadingly labelled. `/v2/trade/profit-loss/charges` remains aggregate-only for per-fill purposes. Regression tests cover both mislabelled cases.
- Implementation `3486d854dae2451858a858cb627602aca7338969`; tests `6c92101a1890a0f4d761e86ed3db047a269fd10d`. The prior head passed workflow #40111501429; latest implementation/test CI must be verified.
- Production mappings/tariffs unapproved; null is not zero; automatic quantity/notional allocation and live order submission disabled. PR #6 draft/unmerged. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` untouched.


## Authoritative checkpoint — 26 October 2026 (documentation CI verified)

- Repository: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; branch: `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`.
- Latest implementation commit: `ac7d27f2c9922925483b5b906c484c0d5a4e3f53`; exact-head Backend CI [#40287765745 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40287765745).
- Documentation synchronization commit: `f90573d653c7103bf9cfdb1f867da97b176d3240`; its exact-head Backend CI [#40289107666 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40289107666). Backend tests, broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore/evidence retention passed. Synthetic restore is not proof of actual Oracle Cloud recovery.
- Approved public Upstox STT/exchange rules are estimate-only. Account-specific actual charges, GST taxable-base composition, stamp duty, SEBI/DP/demat/other charges, unsupported exchange/segment mappings, and per-fill actual evidence remain unapproved. Candidate tariff entries remain DRAFT unless separately allowlisted and reviewed.
- Phase 3 remains in progress. Next gates: independently reviewed tariff applicability; component-specific per-fill allocation rules; invoice/source-backed GST/IPFT and product/segment evidence; final adversarial, migration and recovery review; exact-head acceptance sign-off. Do not repeat canonical live-fill integration.
- Safety: PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes, automatic live-fill promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. PR #6 stays open/draft/unmerged without explicit user approval. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.
- This documentation commit’s CI is green. Continue only from this checkpoint and verify CI for every subsequent implementation/checkpoint commit. Historical entries do not supersede this checkpoint.


## Canonical latest Phase 3 checkpoint — 26 October 2026

- **Repository:** `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. **Verified code/evidence head:** `d287da70ce184c904c6f9ede9e4a0edca5839f8f` (commit: “docs: reconcile public Upstox contract note GST examples”).
- **Exact-head CI:** PASS — [GitHub Actions run #40304398632](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40304398632), commit `d287da70ce184c904c6f9ede9e4a0edca5839f8f`; **1,004 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and restore-evidence retention also passed. This is CI evidence, not proof of a real Oracle recovery or broker-origin authenticity.
- **GST/IPFT research:** Three public third-party historical Upstox note copies were reconciled: 11-Feb-2025 base ₹2.97 / IGST ₹0.53; 21-May-2024 base ₹77.56 / IGST ₹13.96 (IPFT ₹0.11 listed outside that note's printed base); 12-Mar-2025 base ₹2.75 / IGST ₹0.50. Printed-base compositions differ historically. The current official Upstox schedule supports the **estimate-only** base of brokerage + transaction charges + demat where applicable + IPFT, with IPFT represented exactly once because it is combined with transaction charges. Do not add SEBI to this current estimate base without current applicable billing evidence; never calculate GST on trade notional or infer zero from missing/null fields.
- **Tax/accounting approval:** all four GST component candidates remain `DRAFT`. Historical public copies do not prove current actual per-fill billing across products/accounts. Actual-charge promotion stays gated; estimate logic and actual invoice reconciliation are distinct. Follow effective dates and preserve raw API/source evidence.
- **Next action when resuming:** continue Phase 3 from this exact commit and checkpoint. Next gate is component-specific GST acceptance cases for equity delivery, intraday, futures and options, then implementation review and exact-head CI; do not restart from earlier saved checkpoints.
- **Safety / PR:** PAPER mode mandatory; live broker `place_order`/`modify_order`/`cancel_order` and automatic live-fill promotion remain disabled. PR #6 remains open, draft and unmerged. Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is not the work target and must remain untouched.
- This checkpoint supersedes older statements in this document about CI being in progress or requiring verification for the pre-`d287da7` head. Historical notes remain history; this is the canonical resume point.
