## Phase 3 source-reconciliation safety correction — 22 October 2026

- Code review identified a safety gap in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py`: the service previously marked rows `RECONCILED` merely because calculated allocations summed to the caller-provided component total. That is arithmetic reconciliation, not independent verification of a broker contract-note source total.
- Fixed in commit `fce01b98ce33760e3361991e8d2ffba01b0ad281`: newly persisted allocations remain `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`; this service clears the reconciliation reference and does not promote them to `RECONCILED`. A separate source-verification workflow must establish provenance and validate the source component total before promotion.
- Updated regression expectation in commit `8c38ab8ecc8114f392e11ea988ac25c3d7c8e2df` to assert pending status and no reconciliation reference even when arithmetic totals match.
- **CI pending:** the code/test commits and documentation commits need a fresh exact-head run. Do not describe this correction as verified until CI passes.
- This deliberately fails closed: matching a number supplied by the caller is not treated as proof that it came from an authentic contract note. Contract-note authenticity/parser, component-specific allocation methodology, source-total verification, and controlled accounting integration remain open Phase 3 gates.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged pending exact-head CI and broader review. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 allocation edge-case hardening — 22 October 2026

- Code review found a rounding edge case in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_service.py`: when a source total was one paise and a zero-weight fill ID sorted before positive-weight IDs, the deterministic largest-remainder tie-break could assign that paise to a fill whose weight was zero.
- Fixed in commit `1f04b5d0c0fc07af15eadd4fe7c70f14ff054f91`: only strictly positive-weight fills participate in residual ranking. Zero-weight fills remain in the result at INR 0.00.
- Added regression coverage in commit `347f9588485bd7452d949dd816ba6966196354f6` for the one-paise/tied-remainder case and the two-paise case.
- **Verification pending:** CI for these code/test commits and the following documentation commits must pass on the exact latest branch head before this fix is called verified. The prior PostgreSQL concurrency success does not include this new change.
- Existing successful PostgreSQL concurrency run: `39737580271` on `d59e7d8`, `527 passed, 1 warning`, with `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` set. New allocation edge-case fix is a separate code change and needs fresh CI.
- Source authenticity, component-appropriate allocation policy, exact source-total reconciliation against real contract-note data, and accounting integration remain release gates. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 PostgreSQL concurrency verification — 22 October 2026

- **Verified green:** GitHub Actions run `39737580271`, commit `d59e7d8a613471c3134b8d0c6dcdb326713ce7eb`, completed successfully. Job `Backend pytest` passed; log summary: `527 passed, 1 warning in 32.20s`.
- The test job environment explicitly set `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` to the dedicated PostgreSQL 16 service. The suite reported no skipped tests, so the opt-in PostgreSQL integration test was not skipped in this run.
- The preceding fixture corrections addressed (1) missing `Base` import and (2) parent user row not flushed before dependent records. The subsequent exact-head run is green.
- This is evidence that the new PostgreSQL concurrency integration test completed successfully in the suite. Keep its specific invariant documented: competing independent sessions target one evidence/component with different fill sets; only one allocation should persist, without partial/mixed rows.
- Remaining gates are not closed by this test: authenticated contract-note provenance/schema, reviewed charge-component allocation methodology and residual handling, reconciliation against source totals, and controlled integration with live-fill accounting still need review/acceptance. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending review of the full change and its broader release gates.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## PostgreSQL concurrency-test fixture correction — 22 October 2026

- Inspected failed workflow `39737225306` on commit `d6a9cab`. PostgreSQL test failed during fixture setup, before the race assertion: the `broker_connections.user_id` foreign key referenced a user not yet flushed to PostgreSQL. The suite result was `1 failed, 526 passed, 1 warning`.
- Fixed in code commit `0c4d5133a1224fbac5b0eb2cafb3b7c195612d40`: explicitly flush the user parent row before adding dependent portfolio/instrument/connection rows. No production behavior was changed.
- **Pending:** exact-head CI for `0c4d513` and subsequent documentation commits. Do not infer that the concurrency test passes from this fixture correction alone.
- Acceptance remains: on PostgreSQL, two independent sessions race different fill sets against the same evidence/component; exactly one complete allocation set succeeds, the other fails closed, and no partial/mixed ledger remains.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged until this test and exact-head CI pass. Contract-note authenticity, allocation methodology review, and accounting integration remain separate gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## PostgreSQL concurrency-test CI correction — 22 October 2026

- First run of the new integration test failed before reaching the race assertion: `NameError: Base is not defined` in test schema setup. Suite result was `1 failed, 526 passed, 1 warning` on commit `1859179`.
- Fixed by importing `Base` from `app.core.database` in commit `eb4b6c4`. This is a test setup correction only; it does not weaken production checks.
- **Pending verification:** CI for `eb4b6c4` and the documentation commits is not yet confirmed green. The PostgreSQL test's runtime race behavior remains unverified until it executes successfully against the CI PostgreSQL 16 service.
- The test provisions isolated records and races two independent sessions against one evidence/component. Acceptance criterion: exactly one allocation request succeeds, the other fails closed, and exactly one allocation row remains.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until exact-head CI passes and the concurrency result is inspected. Evidence authenticity, valid charge basis, and integration with live accounting remain separate gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 PostgreSQL concurrency test added — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`, an opt-in integration test that uses `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`, two independent SQLAlchemy sessions and concurrent threads to race incompatible single-fill allocations against one reviewed evidence record/component. The expected result is exactly one winner and one persisted allocation, with no mixed/partial fill set.
- The existing `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` provisions PostgreSQL 16 and exports `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`; the integration test creates ORM metadata in that dedicated CI test database because pytest runs before the later Alembic migration verification step.
- Test setup was corrected to build the required portfolio → instrument → order → broker-order → broker-trade foreign-key chain. Test commits: `a69e083`, `4b5e8cc`, `1859179`.
- **Pending:** this new PostgreSQL concurrency test has not yet been confirmed green by exact-head CI. A green prior run does not cover these commits. If CI fails, inspect the test output and correct the fixture or concurrency assumptions before claiming safety.
- The evidence-row `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` is the serialization point. This integration test is the empirical verification needed; SQLite-only unit tests are insufficient.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending successful exact-head CI and review. Contract-note authenticity, component-appropriate allocation basis and live accounting integration remain separate release gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 continuation — PostgreSQL concurrency test still required — 22 October 2026

- Latest confirmed successful workflow remains `39735969492` on commit `a94760f66d5405a563cca25960c95f00ba2a4e5f`; it is a PR-triggered backend-tests run. No later code change is represented by that result.
- Rechecked the allocation persistence service and test setup. The default test fixture explicitly forces SQLite in-memory; it does not exercise PostgreSQL row locks. The workflow file is named `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` (not `ci.yml`).
- Source evidence is locked with SQLAlchemy `with_for_update()` before fill rows and existing allocations are queried. This is a plausible PostgreSQL serialization point but is not yet race-tested with two independent transactions.
- Next step remains an opt-in integration test using a dedicated PostgreSQL test database/URL and two independent sessions racing different fill sets against the same evidence/component. The test must assert one complete winner and one fail-closed conflict, with no partial rows. CI must provision PostgreSQL or clearly report the integration test as skipped; a skipped test is not proof of safety.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged pending that test and exact-head green CI. Source document authenticity, allocation-basis review and accounting-service integration remain separate release gates. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- All changes in this project remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 checkpoint — concurrency safeguard and verification boundary — 22 October 2026

- Confirmed latest recorded successful GitHub Actions run for this branch: `39735332590`, commit `9ed382f5872faaf2c20f71e4292ac5cc3baf322f` (backend tests, success).
- The source-evidence `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock is implemented in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py` before fill-set lookup/allocation persistence. This is intended to serialize concurrent allocations for the same evidence on PostgreSQL.
- **Important verification limit:** the green run is for commit `9ed382f`; it does not include any later changes. The current test file still lacks a PostgreSQL-backed concurrent allocation test. Do not claim race-safety has been empirically proven until that test runs against PostgreSQL with two independent sessions/transactions.
- Next implementation step: add an opt-in integration test using a dedicated PostgreSQL test URL (e.g. `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`) that starts two transactions attempting incompatible fill sets against one evidence/component; verify the second waits/re-reads the ledger and fails closed without partial rows. If CI does not provide a PostgreSQL service for pytest, add a dedicated PostgreSQL test job rather than treating SQLite `FOR UPDATE` behavior as equivalent.
- After the test, run full exact-head CI, inspect logs, and update this checkpoint with the observed result. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until verified.
- Charge-note authenticity, appropriate per-component allocation methodology, and accounting-service integration remain review gates. No automatic accounting promotion or live broker submission is enabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 concurrent allocation serialization — 22 October 2026

- Latest previously verified CI head `9e07a5c95401ab3ccfd6c32a8223721dd573b928` passed, including backend pytest, broker write-boundary enforcement, and Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade on SQLite and PostgreSQL 16.
- Code commit `34dd6cebb424f50963a3ca788de37490d39bdb60` adds a row-level lock on the reviewed `BrokerChargeEvidence` record before locking fill rows and inspecting/inserting component allocations. Rationale: locking only the target fills does not serialize two concurrent requests using disjoint fill sets against the same evidence/component; both could otherwise observe an empty ledger and insert different subsets. PostgreSQL's evidence-row lock provides a per-source serialization point.
- **Pending validation:** run exact-head CI for `34dd6ce` and the documentation commits. SQLite does not enforce `FOR UPDATE`; green SQLite tests alone are not proof of concurrency behavior. Add or run a PostgreSQL-backed concurrent test before treating race safety as fully verified.
- No live accounting promotion was enabled. Evidence authenticity and the economic correctness of a selected allocation basis remain review-gated.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. All changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Replay-basis test correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest CI failed on head `bac124af41342293e5bceba8d5641e85184bee16`: `525 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning`. The new test supplied `ALTERNATE_REVIEWED`, which is intentionally not a supported allocation basis; validation rejected it before replay-conflict detection.
- Test-only correction committed as `6b91827d6a4a01ea93009d664d467ca32d5ec342`: the test now uses `QUANTITY`, a supported basis distinct from the original `EXPLICIT_REVIEWED`, so it exercises the intended changed-basis replay guard without weakening production validation.
- **Pending:** exact-head CI for `6b91827` and documentation updates must pass before replay-basis coverage is marked green.
- Concurrency review remains open: unique evidence/trade/component rows protect duplicate per-fill rows, but do not alone prove correct handling of concurrent conflicting fill sets. PostgreSQL integration coverage is required.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 rollback CI verified; replay-basis test added — 22 October 2026

- CI run `39734057700` passed for commit `85e022e630682da50b1b9e906a8b5986e541d97b`. This confirms the explicit SQLite transaction-boundary correction fixed the rollback test on that head.
- Added a new regression test to reject a replay that changes the reviewed allocation basis, while preserving the existing exact-replay behavior. Test commits: `3f912a1b02cea3880cd7020dea88fa9cbf1185f9` and helper correction `25695e5fc6a1d65f9344bd44f3229c9fa90a69a0`.
- **Pending verification:** the new replay-basis test and following documentation commits have not yet passed exact-head CI. Do not count them as green until CI completes.
- Concurrency note: the model has a unique constraint on evidence + trade + component, which prevents duplicate rows for a fill, but it does not by itself serialize concurrent requests that race with different fill sets. Before merge, add/review a database-backed concurrency strategy and test on PostgreSQL; SQLite alone cannot prove row-lock semantics.
- Still not proven: contract-note authenticity, legally/economically appropriate allocation basis, and integration with live accounting. No automatic accounting promotion is enabled.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Work remains confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## SQLite rollback test infrastructure correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest exact-head CI `39733775193` failed again: `524 passed, 1 failed`. The explicit session transaction still did not roll back the rows because SQLite's legacy driver transaction mode did not issue a physical `BEGIN` before the service's nested SAVEPOINT.
- Test-only infrastructure correction committed as `d49e3cdfae519dc7d7f80bdcda882fcaa6842c51`: configure the in-memory SQLite test engine with explicit transaction boundaries (disable driver-managed implicit transaction control and emit `BEGIN` on SQLAlchemy's begin event). This is the documented SQLAlchemy pattern for reliable SAVEPOINT behavior; it changes test setup, not production database code.
- **Pending:** rerun CI for this commit and documentation updates; only mark rollback coverage resolved if the test passes.
- If the rollback test still fails, stop and replace it with a database-specific integration test rather than weakening the assertion. Concurrent conflicting replay tests remain next after green CI.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Rollback-test CI failure and correction — 22 October 2026

- CI run `39733515473` failed at commit `c9adf3b9da90e1a2d350c216ccdb923ac3ba41a8`: **524 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning**. The only failure was the new rollback test, which assumed the shared SQLite test session had a real outer transaction. The fixture commits setup records, and SQLite can release a SAVEPOINT without an explicit outer `BEGIN`.
- Corrective test commit: `f941b4bf32c8be77ad4c8c17811632ed77b540f0`. The test now starts an explicit outer transaction around the allocation service and rolls that transaction back before asserting no allocation rows remain. This tests caller-owned transaction rollback instead of relying on SQLite's implicit transaction behavior.
- **Pending verification:** exact-head CI for `f941b4b` and the documentation commits must pass before this rollback regression is considered resolved.
- No application transaction semantics were changed by this test-only correction. The service still leaves commit/rollback to its caller. Remaining follow-up: concurrent conflicting replay tests and database-level serialization review.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 rollback test checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Exact-head CI verified green for the corrected connection-safety assertion and latest documentation head `a19313ccba7c2fe79c6ac588d3acb81cd4168dce`; run `39733212480` and latest docs run `39733267668` both completed successfully.
- Added `test_outer_transaction_rollback_removes_all_new_allocations` in commit `c9adf3b9da90e1a2d350c216ccdb923ac3ba41a8`. It confirms the persistence service does not commit on the caller's behalf and a caller rollback removes all allocation rows created in that transaction.
- **Pending:** run exact-head CI for the rollback test and subsequent documentation commits. Do not count this new test as passed until the run succeeds.
- Remaining review: database-level uniqueness already guards duplicate evidence/trade/component rows; simultaneous imports can still require stronger serialization/unique source-component identity and explicit conflicting concurrent replay coverage. Source-document authenticity and allocation-basis suitability remain manual/review-gated; no accounting promotion is wired.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged and live broker submission/automatic accounting promotion gated. Changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Follow-up CI diagnosis — 22 October 2026

- The corrected-fixture CI run `39732808218` failed after executing the tests: **523 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning**. The remaining failure was an overly specific expected error-message regex in the cross-connection rejection test; the service correctly rejected the trade with `Every broker trade record must belong to the evidence connection.`
- Fix committed as `6ff7d5bfc442f7fa06f6df9299b23199faf04d3d`: align the assertion with the service's actual safety error. This is a test assertion correction, not a relaxation of the connection guard.
- The exact-head CI for `6ff7d5b` must be checked before declaring the regression resolved.
- Next after CI passes: add explicit rollback coverage, then review concurrent/replayed allocation behavior and database constraints. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until the full required checks pass.
- Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.

---

## CI failure analysis and correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest persistence-test CI failed on commit `f7d84cd695192e59bee12f1de625e570746a2e88`: backend pytest reported `519 passed, 1 warning, 5 errors`.
- Root cause from the job log: all five new persistence tests requested a `reviewed_evidence` fixture that did not exist. This was test setup failure, not evidence that the allocation assertions passed.
- Corrective commit `a1149cbff48357fd9aab006de7fe3435a89cbed0` adds a local fixture creating a user, broker connection, and reviewed contract-note evidence row using the actual model fields. The new commit must still pass exact-head CI before this issue can be considered resolved.
- Next: verify CI for the corrected head. If green, add rollback and concurrency/replay tests. If it fails, inspect job logs and fix before proceeding.
- No merge; no live-accounting promotion. Work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 persistence-test checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added database-backed tests for successful component allocation and exact source-total reconciliation, idempotent identical replay, conflicting replay with changed total, cross-connection trade rejection, and changed fill-set rejection without partial rows.
- Tests use the existing isolated SQLAlchemy test-session fixture. They are committed to the Phase 3 branch; exact-head CI for this test commit and the documentation commits still needs verification.
- Review note: the current persistence service marks a component `RECONCILED` as soon as stored allocations sum to the source total. This is arithmetic reconciliation only, not proof that the chosen allocation basis is correct or the source document is authentic. No live-fill accounting promotion is wired to it.
- **Next:** verify exact-head CI; fix test/migration issues. Then add explicit transaction rollback coverage and consider DB-level concurrency/idempotency enforcement for simultaneous identical/conflicting imports before any merge.
- Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. All changes are confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 transactional allocation persistence checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py` to validate reviewed contract-note evidence, enforce that every referenced persisted broker trade belongs to the same broker connection, and persist per-fill component allocations in a database savepoint.
- Replay handling: identical replay requests return the existing allocation rows; changed fill sets, totals, allocation values, basis, method version, currency, or rejected rows fail closed. Allocations are marked `RECONCILED` only when the full fill set exists and the sum equals the source component total exactly.
- This service uses the existing deterministic largest-remainder utility and writes a reconciliation reference. It does not authenticate the original contract-note document, choose an economically/legal basis, parse broker files, or enable accounting promotion.
- **Validation still required:** exact-head CI and DB-backed integration tests for successful allocation, identical replay, conflicting replay, cross-connection fill rejection, partial failure rollback, and migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade. Treat the implementation as unverified until those pass.
- **Next:** run CI, add database-backed persistence tests and repair issues found; then review concurrency/idempotency behavior and synchronize the PR description/docs. Do not merge until exact-head CI is green.
- Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. Changes remain limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 allocation-math checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_service.py` with deterministic largest-remainder allocation math using Decimal values and integer paise, stable fill-ID tie-breaking, explicit method version, and source-total equality check.
- Added regression tests for source-total reconciliation, input-order independence, tie-breaking, zero weights, invalid/negative/non-finite values, unsupported basis, and paise precision.
- **Important limitation:** this is a pure allocation-math utility, not yet the durable persistence/orchestration service. It does not read reviewed evidence, bind trade rows to a connection, write immutable ledger rows, reconcile stored component totals across all fills, or gate execution promotion. A caller must select an explicitly reviewed basis appropriate to the charge component; no basis is inferred here.
- Existing schema migration/model slice had CI success at PR head `1505b71198f7f9f42ad749588597b7c8bb63eb0d`, run [39730707245](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39730707245). The newer service/tests/docs commits still require exact-head CI verification.
- **Next:** verify latest CI and correct failures; then implement a transactional persistence service that validates reviewed evidence + same-connection trades, inserts replay-safe rows, and marks a component reconciled only when the allocations sum exactly to its source total. Add DB-backed tests for idempotency, conflicting replays, foreign-connection evidence/trades, and rollback.
- Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. All work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` must remain untouched.

---

## Phase 3 allocation-ledger implementation checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation` (based on verified main `54342a69249c9a790544c415842ec74c9ddf57fb`).
- **Initial implementation slice:** added `BrokerChargeAllocation` model and migration `202610220010`, registered the model, and added schema-contract tests. Ledger fields capture source evidence, broker connection, broker trade record, charge component, source component total, allocated amount in INR paise precision, allocation basis, method version, reconciliation state, and an optional reconciliation reference.
- **Idempotency constraint:** unique `(evidence_id, broker_trade_record_id, charge_component)`; supported components and nonnegative amounts are database-constrained. New rows default to `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`.
- **Not yet complete:** this is the durable schema foundation only. There is not yet a persistence/allocation service, cross-record validation that evidence and trade belong to the same connection, immutable-update enforcement, deterministic rounding/residual algorithm, source-total reconciliation, or linkage to execution promotion. Do not claim live accounting is using this ledger.
- **Verification:** exact-head CI has not yet been observed for this branch. Do not merge until backend tests and SQLite/PostgreSQL migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks pass.
- **Next:** validate migration/tests, add a service that uses Decimal/paise arithmetic only when an explicitly reviewed basis is authorized, enforces evidence/connection/trade binding and replay-safe inserts, and reconciles each source component total exactly. Ambiguous allocations must remain pending and block promotion.
- **Safety/scope:** keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. All changes are limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## End-of-day checkpoint — 21 October 2026 (post-merge verification)

- PR #5 (`Phase 3: add fail-closed reviewed charge evidence validator`) was squash-merged into `main` as commit `3f9c3f2c99d8f1afcbdd7a00933c9451c7ae35c7`.
- Feature-branch exact-head CI passed at commit `6cd76bbe430d49032234a1e0d804158562c17553` in run [39639800746](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39639800746).
- Post-merge `main` CI for merge commit `3f9c3f2c99d8f1afcbdd7a00933c9451c7ae35c7` is run [39640095959](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39640095959); last checked status was `in_progress` for Backend pytest. Do not mark post-merge CI green until a completed successful result is verified.
- **Next action on resume:** re-check run `39640095959` first. If failed, inspect logs, fix, commit, and verify exact-head CI. If successful, proceed to the durable per-fill charge-allocation ledger: immutable allocations, deterministic paise rounding/residual policy, source-total reconciliation, idempotency/replay, partial fills and crash recovery.
- Phase 3 remains incomplete. Contract-note import/parsing and authenticated-source validation are not yet complete; evidence hash/review status are not proof of broker authenticity. Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated.
- Scope remains strictly `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

<!-- Phase 3 checkpoint sync: 2026-10-21; branch phase3/reviewed-charge-evidence-gate; commit 42a7418c674d92af9d099b1095d90af660678e2b; exact-head CI run 39638875688 passed. -->

## Latest verified Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Code/test commit:** `42a7418c674d92af9d099b1095d90af660678e2b` on `phase3/reviewed-charge-evidence-gate` in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.
- **Exact-head CI:** GitHub Actions run [39638875688](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39638875688) completed successfully. Backend pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, and PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passed.
- **New regression coverage:** rejects charge evidence from non-contract-note sources and mismatched reviewer identities. Existing evidence validation covers connection binding, reference matching, reviewed status, reviewer identity and review timestamp.
- **Scope and safety:** PR #5 remains open and unmerged as of this checkpoint. Evidence metadata/hash and a review status are provenance/workflow controls, not cryptographic proof of broker authenticity. Contract-note parsing/import, immutable per-fill charge allocation, deterministic paise rounding/residual handling, source-total reconciliation, and complete replay/partial-fill/crash-recovery acceptance remain unfinished.
- **Next:** continue with a reviewed contract-note import boundary and a durable, idempotent per-fill allocation ledger; do not invent charge splits. Keep live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling disabled until release gates pass.
- **Repository constraint:** changes must remain in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository.

## Authoritative Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Current code-and-documentation HEAD before this documentation sync:** `4fe58dd11b018d1f85000540ad2ec1b7f6f52ae5`. Its exact-HEAD push CI [run 39633514414](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633514414) completed successfully. Backend pytest, broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade-downgrade-reupgrade checks all passed.
- **Evidence-ledger implementation:** `6c0a382eb9fea7f386433cfdb65a65cbc53f218e`; migration correction: `c17f522bf68121a6d162a4d858cd9de8b95d45d1`. Their CI runs [39633266180](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633266180) and [39633330531](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633330531) both passed.
- **Implemented:** `BrokerChargeEvidence` model and migration `202610210009`; captures broker connection, report metadata, filename, SHA-256 fingerprint, byte size, parser version, and review status. Tests cover persistence, duplicate-fingerprint rejection per connection, and database constraints.
- **Limits:** a hash detects byte-level changes but does not prove broker origin. The ledger does not yet retain document bytes, import/parse the broker document, establish authenticity, or allocate charge components to fills. `REVIEWED` is a workflow status, not automatic approval to promote live accounting.
- **Next Phase 3 gate:** build a fail-closed, idempotent contract-note import/review boundary and inspect a real redacted broker contract note before selecting charge-specific allocation rules. Then implement immutable per-fill allocation records, paise rounding/residual rules, source-total reconciliation, and replay/crash/partial-fill tests.
- **Phase 3 remains in progress.** Keep live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling disabled. Phase 2 remains closed. All changes must stay in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- Older checkpoints below are historical; this section is authoritative until replaced by a later verified checkpoint.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Latest verified code/test HEAD:** `3963c2bf4e6ffe2bb33d327b10e2995cd243d003`. Exact-head [Backend CI run 39607630055](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39607630055) passed **484 tests, 1 warning in 29.34s**; the broker-write boundary guard passed, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- New Phase 3 guard: broker-reported live-fill charge references are trimmed for storage and rejected when longer than the `Execution.charge_reference` 200-character column limit. This prevents a predictable storage error from being misreported as a concurrent promotion conflict. Regression coverage is included in the 484-test result.
- The existing Phase 3 safety gates remain active: replay must match the accounted fill and exact charge evidence; only broker-reported, internally consistent charges with a non-empty audit reference are accepted; durable staged trade quantities must match broker-confirmed child fills before promotion; exchange-time ambiguity/out-of-order fills fail closed; paper positions and cash remain isolated.
- **Phase 3 remains in progress, not complete.** Remaining review includes coordinator/identity boundaries, charge provenance/allocation semantics, full partial-fill and crash/restart acceptance criteria, and any explicitly selected bridge design. Keep `BrokerFillIdentity` separate from manual `BrokerTradeRecord` unless a reviewed Phase 3 design explicitly authorizes a narrow bridge.
- Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository remains untouched. Phase 2 remains closed.
- This checkpoint describes the verified code commit above. The documentation synchronization commit will trigger its own CI; do not treat that documentation commit as green until its exact-head run passes. Older checkpoint entries below are historical audit trail, not current status.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current verified checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Last verified code/test checkpoint:** `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f`; exact-head backend CI [run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386) passed **472 tests, 1 warning**, broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- **Last verified documentation checkpoint before this status refresh:** `391dfefc9580abf9537ee659877578033baae4fd`; exact-head backend CI [run 39568264419](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39568264419) passed.
- The Phase 2 audit covers the dependency/port matrix, broker-fill workflow boundary, idempotency and rollback, reconciliation crash recovery, transaction-level lease fencing, slow persistence, 20 concurrent expiry-boundary renewal/reclaim races, and official Upstox current-day API semantics.
- Official Upstox V2 [order-book](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-order-book/) and [get-trades-for-day](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-history/) endpoints are current-day endpoints without documented pagination parameters. Historical trades use a separate [paginated API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-historical-trades/); it is not wired into the Phase 2 worker.
- **Phase 2 technical checklist is complete.** Before any Phase 3 work, require a passing exact-head CI run for the then-current `main` and explicit user approval; never infer a later commit is green from an earlier run.
- Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling remain disabled. The original `Tradepro` repository remains untouched.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current verified checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Verified code/test checkpoint:** `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f`; exact-head backend CI [run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386) passed **472 tests, 1 warning**, the broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- **Previously verified documentation checkpoint:** `a2e639f61e2c50070deb26d1a9a0741545c9737d`; exact-head backend CI [run 39568011689](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39568011689) passed. This is historical evidence for that SHA; every new commit still requires its own exact-head CI.
- The slow-persistence/lease-race audit is complete: the PostgreSQL row-lock test proves reclaim waits while a fenced write transaction is open; `test_postgres_high_volume_expiry_races_never_resurrect_stale_lease` passed 20 concurrent expiry-boundary renewal/reclaim races. Expired owners cannot renew, and ownership generation/token advance is verified.
- Official Upstox V2 [order-book](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-order-book/) and [get-trades-for-day](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-history/) endpoints are current-day endpoints without documented pagination parameters. Historical trades use a separate [paginated API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-historical-trades/); it is not wired into the Phase 2 worker.
- Phase 2 technical audit and scope reconciliation are complete. Keep Phase 3 blocked until this final documentation commit's exact-head CI passes. Do not enable live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion or automatic scheduling. The original `Tradepro` repository remains untouched.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current verified checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Latest verified code/test HEAD:** `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f`; exact-head backend CI [run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386) passed **472 tests, 1 warning**, the broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- The lease-race audit now has both pieces of evidence: PostgreSQL test `test_postgres_write_fence_blocks_reclaim_until_persistence_transaction_finishes` proves reclaim waits while a fenced transaction holds the lease-row lock; new `test_postgres_high_volume_expiry_races_never_resurrect_stale_lease` runs 20 concurrent expiry-boundary renewal-versus-reclaim races and asserts expired owners cannot renew and generation/token ownership advances safely.
- CI logs confirm the full backend suite and source guard passed; the successful workflow includes SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks. The one Python warning is the existing Starlette/AnyIO deprecation.
- **Current task:** synchronize all authoritative documents with this result. The resulting documentation HEAD still needs exact-head CI and a final stale-status scan before Phase 2 is formally closed. Do not start Phase 3 before then.
- Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling remain disabled. The original `Tradepro` repository remains untouched.

<!-- Authoritative checkpoint audit: 2026-10-21; updated after Phase 2 lease-fencing verification. -->
## Authoritative checkpoint audit — 21 October 2026

- **Repository/branch:** `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, `main`. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is a protected baseline and must remain untouched.
- **Latest code/test commit:** `e56bf4c66f74b875a3ba8fe388138a9d688dd1e2` adds failed-commit rollback coverage. Exact-head backend CI [run 39564568154](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39564568154) passed 471 tests, 1 warning, broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migrations. Documentation HEAD `adb69aeb05b70ba4fa9095fc73d9dea033d31eec` also passed [run 39565251793](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39565251793).
- **Exact-commit backend CI:** [run 39561621808](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39561621808) passed **470 tests, 1 warning**, the broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles. It includes lease-fence ownership/expiry tests, a high-volume batch-stop regression, and a PostgreSQL contention test proving an expired lease cannot be reclaimed while a fenced persistence transaction still holds the row lock.
- **Documentation checkpoint CI:** [run 39561881539](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39561881539) passed on documentation commit `292cad087bf0febad7793dcec164ebb5435726e8`; this follow-up synchronizes the closure wording and design note.
- **Frontend:** no frontend files changed in this Phase 2 patch. The latest verified frontend CI remains [run 39554328474](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39554328474), which passed TypeScript and Next.js build on code/test commit `14995e5b41b3014b7de9d50a8466ac1cce4a77e6`.
- **Previously completed Phase 2 protections:** atomic run/lease finalization; stale-owner protection; cancellation and interrupted-run recovery; inconsistent token/expiry rejection; five-record renewal checks; and incomplete-summary warnings for `WORKER_INTERRUPTED` and `LEASE_LOST`.
- **Newly completed lease-expiry audit:** every worker-owned reconciliation persistence operation (fill identity, review issue, order transition and fill-to-intent link) now obtains a current, unexpired lease fence immediately before the write. The lease row is locked through the repository's persistence transaction, so a competing claimant must wait until that transaction commits or rolls back. Lease loss fails closed before the next mutation.
- **Scope clarification:** Phase 2's defined engineering checks are verified, including the dependency/port matrix, identity boundary, rollback coverage, full backend suite, PostgreSQL concurrency, source guard and reversible migrations. The final documentation sync must pass exact-HEAD CI before Phase 3 begins. Phase 3/4-only safety features remain deferred by design.
- **Scope remains unchanged:** external-repository borrowing/adaptation is paused; no outside application code was imported. Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling remain disabled. Keep `BrokerFillIdentity` separate from `BrokerTradeRecord`; do not wholesale-merge the divergent safety branch.
- Intermediate CI runs on partially applied commits were red while the new regression test preceded its matching fix; the final code/test commit above is the authoritative green result. Do not count those intermediate failures as the current code status.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current scope and backlog clarification — 21 October 2026

- The **reconciliation crash-recovery/lease-fencing slice** is complete. Code/test commit `fe07b77b193da1232787384efb38cb589e0d71b6` passed backend CI run [39561621808](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39561621808): 470 tests, 1 warning, broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles.
- The documentation synchronization commit is CI-checked separately; use the live [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions) to verify the exact current `main` HEAD. Do not infer exact-HEAD CI from an earlier commit.
- **This does not mean the entire Phase 2/Phase 2 roadmap is backlog-free.** Phase 2 still has open work: complete the safety-branch dependency matrix, resolve the `BrokerFillIdentity` versus manual `BrokerTradeRecord` workflow boundary before any bridge, and complete the remaining focused accounting/idempotency/rollback tests for any selected port slice.
- Phase 3 live-fill accounting integration and Phase 4 live-trading release gates remain future work and are intentionally blocked. No live submission, automatic accounting promotion, or automatic scheduling is enabled.
- External-repository borrowing remains paused; the original `Tradepro` repository remains untouched. Keep `BrokerFillIdentity` separate from `BrokerTradeRecord`; do not wholesale-merge the divergent safety branch.

## Authoritative continuation checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- Latest code/test commit: [e56bf4c66f74b875a3ba8fe388138a9d688dd1e2](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/e56bf4c66f74b875a3ba8fe388138a9d688dd1e2), adding a regression test that simulates database commit failure during live-fill promotion and asserts rollback leaves no Execution/LivePosition and does not alter the paper position.
- **Exact-head CI is not yet confirmed.** The commit-status query returned no statuses and the available workflow lookup returned no runs; neither result proves pass or failure. Verify the actual GitHub Actions run for this commit before closing Phase 2.
- The earlier reconciliation crash-recovery/lease-fencing checkpoint remains verified by backend run [39561621808](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39561621808) (470 passed, 1 warning; source guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migrations passed). This older run does not cover the newest test.
- The workflow-boundary decision is resolved for Phase 2: keep BrokerFillIdentity (intent-reconciliation evidence) separate from manual BrokerTradeRecord staging. Do not bridge or dual-write them. The dependency/port matrix is SAFETY_BRANCH_PORT_MATRIX.md; defer Phase 3/Phase 4-only safety, coordinator, charge-adjustment, and broker-write features instead of merging the safety branch wholesale.
- **Previous verified checkpoint:** code/test HEAD `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f` passed [CI run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386). Current documentation sync and its exact-head CI status are recorded in the top checkpoint. Keep live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling disabled. Original Tradepro remains untouched.

# Tradepro Improved — Handover

Last reviewed: 2026-10-21  
Repository: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved  
Working branch: `main`

## Non-negotiable safeguards
- Work only in this repository. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is a protected baseline and must remain untouched.
- Preserve existing behavior and use small, reviewable changes. Inspect the current branch before every change.
- Never place real broker orders in tests. Keep live order submission disabled; PAPER remains the safe default.
- Do not claim tests or migrations passed unless the exact run/commit proves it. Do not deploy production migrations without backup and staging verification.
- Do not merge or cherry-pick `safety/fail-closed-trading-mode` wholesale: the branch is materially divergent from `main`.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current main-branch baseline
- Latest verified code/test checkpoint: `84f3a3e48a64b6e1d764a87a2b337b2a8f052741`.
- GitHub Actions [run 39482592808](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39481385581): **439 passed, 1 warning**. SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade → downgrade → re-upgrade checks passed.
- Documentation commits after that code checkpoint record the baseline discrepancy and branch comparison. Exact-head CI after those documentation commits must be checked before calling the latest HEAD green.
- Current `main` has 38 `backend/tests/test_*.py` modules, including Upstox response parsing, broker trade staging and child-order reconciliation. The 18 October safety checkpoint at `9085d9fbdcc8ee2dd8baac6f5e73f92bd76cfa8b` recorded **456 passed, 8 skipped, 1 warning** in [run 39140514552](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39140514552), with 48 test modules on that branch. Twenty-two test modules and 19 related API/model/service paths from that branch remain absent on `main`. This is a different code/test tree, not proof that exactly 101 tests were deleted from the same commit line.
- GitHub reports the selected branch comparison as divergent (389 commits ahead / 1,029 behind). Port behavior and tests in dependency-complete slices; do not copy isolated tests that import absent services.
- Migration audit: 14 revision files form a linear chain from `202608170001` through terminal head `202610180008`, with no missing parent reference. CI verifies reversible migration cycles on SQLite and PostgreSQL 16.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current implementation boundaries
- The app has a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend, paper trading, instrument sync, Upstox market-data streaming, portfolio risk controls, and a read-only reconciliation UI/worker foundation.
- The live-fill accounting service and supporting broker-order/trade/live-position models exist on `main`; the service remains intentionally unregistered.
- Broker-confirmed trade ingestion into reconciliation, one-transaction promotion into Execution/live positions with charge provenance, parent-order status accounting, and end-to-end crash/replay recovery are not yet complete.
- Live order submission is not implemented as a safe end-to-end path. Do not enable it. No real broker request or production migration was performed in the verified checkpoint.

## Immediate next task
Build a dependency map between the safety branch's missing tests and the source/migrations they require. Select one coherent behavior slice (start with broker trade staging and response parsing), inspect current `main` implementations, port only the required behavior, add compatible regression tests, run focused tests and full backend/PostgreSQL/migration CI, then record exact commit and run IDs in `PROGRESS.md` and `AUDIT_REPORT.md`.

## Required working sequence
Read `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and this handover. Then: inspect → map requirement/source/test dependencies → make one minimal change → run targeted tests → run relevant full suite and migrations → commit → update progress/audit → inspect exact-head CI. Keep all broker writes disabled.



## Resume checkpoint — broker-write source guard (2026-10-21)

This update supersedes the earlier "Immediate next task" paragraph above.

- Latest code/config commit: `c563683b85d7801cd19dcf3d1c7784ec6e433d1f`; current docs have been advanced in subsequent commits. Verify actual `main` HEAD before further writes.
- Added `backend/scripts/check_broker_write_boundary.py`, seven focused tests, and a required backend CI step. Documentation now records this guard.
- The previous 439-pass run applies to commit `84f3a3e48a64b6e1d764a87a2b337b2a8f052741`, not automatically to the new source-guard changes. The connected workflow tool does not list push-triggered runs; exact-head CI must be checked before claiming this step passed.
- First next action: inspect the CI result for current `main`; if it fails, read the guard findings and correct the scanner or narrowly document proven PAPER-only exceptions. Never blanket-ignore a broker-write call.
- After exact-head CI, continue the mapped safety-branch audit with one dependency-complete slice. Keep the intent worker's `BrokerFillIdentity` and manual-order `BrokerTradeRecord` paths separate until a reviewed bridge is designed. No live broker submission or automatic fill promotion.


## Resume note — tightened broker-write source guard (2026-10-21)

- Current work narrowed AST guard exemptions: the whole Upstox adapter is scanned, and the portfolios endpoint exception is limited to the actual `place_order` and `cancel_order` functions. Added tests for unexpected adapter calls and an unrelated helper in the same module.
- Relevant commits: `00c0986a0628cc6b55b842cfcf6e7fc01b071de4`, `30c1aa7b78de357e070f7cdb37b3719112ee8850`, `a75a15a0feae98fb2eb4d4301f199d33566c0acf`, `430d00ae787a250f5c7f425e2b72ad02a38c396a`.
- **Current verified checkpoint:** code/test HEAD `14995e5b41b3014b7de9d50a8466ac1cce4a77e6`; documentation HEAD `ee3a3889e32b90b105ee2c2ca4fe6ca7c958d84e`.
- **Do next:** the completeness audit found no missing implementation within the read-only reconciliation recovery slice through the renewal-boundary checkpoint. Continue with the documented single-slow-record/high-volume lease-expiry audit; do not restart recovery unless new evidence identifies a concrete gap. Keep live submission and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Verified resume checkpoint — 2026-10-21

- Current `main` HEAD `975717b05a3aa5faa030f3f9e177dbcf6066daf3` is verified green: [GitHub Actions run 39550130192](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39550130192), **447 passed, 1 warning**. The AST broker-write guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- The preceding commit's CI failure was caused by an incorrect expected line number in the guard test; the assertion was corrected in the current head. No current CI failure is open.
- Resume Phase 2 by reviewing the dependency map and deciding whether `BrokerFillIdentity` and `BrokerTradeRecord` represent separate workflows or need a carefully specified transactional bridge. Do not connect them before defining identity, owner/account scope, conflict handling, idempotent replay, rollback and crash recovery.
- Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion disabled.

## Resume checkpoint — fill-workflow boundary review (2026-10-21)

- Latest code/test commit: `3683082509c4b331ab9c7ebceb928e925414de35` adds regression assertions that the intent-based reconciliation worker never creates manual `BrokerTradeRecord` staging rows, `Execution`, or `LivePosition`, and does not change portfolio cash, including on replay. Exact-head CI is pending.
- Architecture decision: keep `BrokerFillIdentity` and `BrokerTradeRecord` separate for now. They represent the intent-based reconciliation evidence path and the manual Order staging/accounting path, respectively. Their independent uniqueness constraints do not deduplicate across tables.
- Do not bridge or dual-write until canonical fill identity, owner/connection/order/intent linkage, conflict semantics, atomicity, idempotent replay, rollback and crash recovery are designed and tested.
- Next: verify exact-head CI, then continue Phase 2 stale-run/crash-recovery review. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.

## Resume checkpoint — orphaned run recovery (2026-10-21)

- Added explicit recovery for stale `RUNNING` reconciliation summaries. `fail_orphaned_runs` only marks a run `FAILED/WORKER_INTERRUPTED` when it is older than the cutoff and the scoped broker connection has no unexpired lease; it does not rerun broker I/O or touch fills/accounting.
- Tests cover stale run, active lease, user/connection scoping, cutoff validation. SQLite timestamp normalization and active-lease transaction rollback are included.
- Latest implementation commits: `c21dc711c9102c4a6f0aad36b404ba8c1b57d5f8`, `007383da7f0ca5a1793098288f610ed98de9eb71`, `298caa0a1a05124cdf6fdc9d94ff0644f20295a5`. Verify CI for the exact latest head before further changes.
- The recovery method is not wired to a scheduler yet. Keep the two fill workflows separate; no live broker submission or automatic accounting promotion.

## Latest verified checkpoint — stale-run recovery (2026-10-21)

- Exact current code head `c1c0d8c6fbbb5dcc1389d2da77e911c815958d88`, [GitHub Actions run 39551504884](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39551504884): **455 passed, 1 warning**; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles passed.
- Worker recovery now runs before lease claim. Stale owner/connection-scoped `RUNNING` summaries become `FAILED/WORKER_INTERRUPTED` only when no unexpired lease is active; a recovery error prevents lease claim and broker I/O.
- Next: test recovery/lease-claim races on PostgreSQL and ensure interrupted run summaries are presented as incomplete. The stored summary counters are not incremental; zero values with `WORKER_INTERRUPTED` are not proof of no partial work.
- Keep `BrokerFillIdentity` and `BrokerTradeRecord` separate, live broker submission disabled, and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Latest verified checkpoint — orphan recovery race and UI warning (2026-10-21)

- Exact current code/test HEAD `d0437be8ef27c4e86d659a9b85bf42dbdb99ecc4`: [backend run 39552046237](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39552046237) passed **456 tests, 1 warning**, source guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles; [frontend run 39552046207](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39552046207) passed TypeScript and Next.js build.
- PostgreSQL concurrency test now races orphan recovery against expired-lease claim and asserts that recovery and lease ownership cannot both win. The UI explicitly labels `WORKER_INTERRUPTED` counters as incomplete.
- Next: audit the crash window between lease release and summary persistence, and inconsistent lease state (token present but expiry missing). Keep recovery metadata-only, preserve separate fill workflows, and keep live submission/accounting promotion disabled.


## Resume checkpoint — Phase 2 lease/crash recovery (2026-10-21)

- Current verified code/test HEAD: `0ce59a7965e3e96a425fa8ae30c841eb0cb755bc`.
- Exact-head [backend CI run 39552821228](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39552821228) passed 461 tests, 1 warning, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration cycle, and PostgreSQL 16 migration cycle. Frontend TypeScript/build last passed on `d0437be8ef27c4e86d659a9b85bf42dbdb99ecc4`; no frontend files changed after that.
- Both `fail_orphaned_runs` and `LiveReconciliationLeaseRepository.claim` reject a lease with exactly one of token/expiry populated. Claim SQL only reclaims a released (both NULL) or expired lease.
- Regression coverage verifies a crash after lease release but before terminal summary persistence; after the run ages past the cutoff, the next worker marks it `FAILED/WORKER_INTERRUPTED` and proceeds with a new run. This is eventual recovery, not atomic completion.
- Next: decide whether run-summary finish and lease completion should share a transaction, then cover lost-lease and summary-ordering edge cases. Do not enable live submission, automatic accounting promotion, or a scheduler. Keep `BrokerFillIdentity` and `BrokerTradeRecord` separate.


## Latest verified checkpoint — atomic reconciliation lifecycle (2026-10-21)

- Current verified code/test HEAD: `8f967adaa2328f16a0a08a104c3ec394e62f9310`.
- Exact-head [CI run 39553655005](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39553655005) passed 463 tests, 1 warning, broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles.
- Run finalization and lease release now execute in one transaction. A summary update failure rolls back lease release; a stale worker cannot release a newer lease and marks its run `LEASE_LOST` instead.
- The previous simulated-crash test now asserts the lease remains claimed when finalization fails, then verifies eventual orphan recovery after expiry. A repository-level rollback test and a stale-owner/new-owner regression test pass.
- Next: audit cancellation, unexpected exception, and lease renewal/expiry paths. Keep fill workflows separate and all live submission/accounting promotion disabled.


## Latest verified checkpoint — lease loss and cancellation recovery (2026-10-21)

- Current verified code/test HEAD: `2ac6bfaafd3475ee63360bd0049b0b6987236bc1`.
- Exact-head [backend CI run 39553981172](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39553981172) passed 465 tests, 1 warning, broker-write guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles.
- Worker now has regression coverage for losing lease ownership before local persistence and for cancellation during broker read followed by expiry-based recovery. A stale owner cannot write fill evidence or release the replacement owner's lease.
- Run-summary terminalization and lease release are atomic; failure rolls back lease release. The crash/cancellation recovery marker remains `WORKER_INTERRUPTED`, whose summary counters are incomplete.
- Next: review lease-renewal cadence for large batches and inspect any remaining cancellation/unexpected-error paths. Keep all live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Latest verified checkpoint — documentation audit and renewal boundary (2026-10-21)

- Code/test HEAD: `14995e5b41b3014b7de9d50a8466ac1cce4a77e6`; backend [run 39554328380](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39554328380): 466 passed, 1 warning, guard and migrations passed; frontend [run 39554328474](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39554328474): TypeScript/build passed. Latest documentation commit `7f9a1f3293ffc67579042a87b82cb2fb03ffba1f` passed [CI run 39556090575](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39556090575).
- Lease renewal now occurs every 5 records during trade/order batches. A regression test simulates lease replacement at a renewal boundary and verifies the worker stops before writing the next record, keeps the new lease owner intact, and marks the run `LEASE_LOST`.
- UI warning now covers `LEASE_LOST` as well as `WORKER_INTERRUPTED`, because neither terminal status guarantees a complete summary.
- Phase 2 lease-expiry audit closed: per-write transaction-level fencing is implemented and verified by backend CI run 39561621808 (470 passed, 1 warning). Do not reopen unless new evidence identifies a regression.


## Phase 3 live-fill accounting checkpoint — 2026-10-21

- Latest reviewed code HEAD at this checkpoint: `ef60ec93d39543c644dfd557f6f73b48ab793b60`.
- Exact-head [Backend CI run 39609474410](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39609474410) completed successfully: **485 passed, 1 warning in 30.25s**; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- The one warning is non-failing; CI logs also report GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation notices.
- Existing safeguards cover replay identity/charge validation, broker-confirmed fill quantities, cumulative child/order quantity limits, rejected-order protection, and atomic live-position/execution updates. This CI result verifies the current HEAD, not completion of all Phase 3 requirements.
- **Open Phase 3 requirement:** define and test the fee-allocation contract when a broker contract-note charge total covers multiple fills. The current API accepts a per-promotion breakdown and validates that its total equals its six components; it does not itself establish how a multi-fill contract-note total is allocated. Do not claim this issue resolved or wire in a coordinator/identity bridge until the rule is designed and regression-tested.
- Safety constraints unchanged: do not enable live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, or automatic scheduling; keep `BrokerFillIdentity` and `BrokerTradeRecord` separate pending a reviewed bridge design. Phase 2 remains closed.


## Phase 3 checkpoint refresh — 2026-10-21

- **Repository boundary:** all current Phase 3 work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, branch `main`. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is a protected baseline and must not be modified.
- **Current HEAD at audit start:** `3b5c8831d4f3475eee320176b3c06bdbd5364bd2` (source-ledger design-gate documentation). The documentation synchronization commit created after this note requires its own exact-HEAD CI result.
- **Latest confirmed backend CI during this audit:** [run 39618611385](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39618611385) completed successfully on **commit `49f95bdd5f20ee99b21a573087c6e97a9bc03526`**, with **485 passed, 1 warning in 30.65s**. The broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade steps passed. This run is an older SHA, not current HEAD; do not label later commits green based on it.
- **Phase 3 status:** in progress. Current blocker is verified actual-charge evidence and an approved allocation basis. Reviewed Upstox documented APIs provide trade data, aggregate charges, or estimates, but no verified per-fill actual-charge source/contract-note ingestion capability was found in the reviewed adapter/API catalogue. Do not treat estimates as actual charges or allocate aggregate totals by guess.
- **Next engineering sequence:** establish authoritative source format and retention/security boundary; then implement immutable source evidence and per-fill allocation records, migration, transactional reconciliation/idempotency, and required regression tests; finally verify exact-HEAD CI.
- **Safety:** live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. Phase 2 remains closed. This checkpoint is status tracking, not a claim that Phase 3 charge allocation is implemented.

## Phase 3 checkpoint refresh — aggregate charge rejection tests (2026-10-21)

- Latest GitHub main commit at refresh: 89d274d08f1ee85bdcb0f0118ce753d1d05bba2c (progress docs commit).
- Added negative-source regression cases in backend/tests/test_live_fill_accounting_service.py at commit b8fa3eca4d2f6181a81ac3efd4d714af10cf5a8c: AGGREGATE_CHARGES, TRADE_CHARGES_API, and BROKER_ESTIMATE are rejected by the existing live-fill promotion validation. This is not source authentication and does not solve the possibility of a caller mislabelling aggregate data as BROKER_REPORTED.
- Official Upstox API schema cross-check is recorded in PHASE3_CHARGE_ALLOCATION_CONTRACT.md and PROGRESS.md: trade-wise P&L is not a complete actual per-fill charge source; the trade charges endpoint is aggregate by period/segment. Do not allocate aggregate levies by guessed proportions or match fills using only symbol/date/average price.
- **Exact-HEAD CI is not verified for 89d274d...** GitHub status/run queries returned no matching records through the available connector. This absence is not evidence of success; do not report the added tests as passed until the workflow run for the exact SHA is visible.
- **Next step:** resolve the CI evidence gap and continue source-provenance design. Do not add a speculative importer or schema migration until an authoritative component-specific allocation basis is available.
- Safety unchanged: live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. Phase 2 remains closed. All changes stay in tradepro-improved; original Tradepro remains untouched.

## Phase 3 source-document access and integrity audit — 22 October 2026

- Audited the existing `BrokerChargeEvidence` model and `require_reviewed_charge_evidence` service on `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. The model persists filename, SHA-256, byte size, parser-version metadata, report reference, and review provenance, but explicitly stores the original document outside the table.
- No broker-contract-note-specific upload/retrieval endpoint or storage adapter was found in the audited application entrypoint, API route locations, service paths, and configuration. This is a scoped audit finding, not proof that no generic file handling exists elsewhere.
- The current evidence validator checks evidence identity/connection, source kind, reviewed status, reviewer identity/timestamp, and report reference. It does not retrieve the original bytes, recompute SHA-256/byte size, or parse an authoritative charge-component total.
- **Step 1 remains in progress; no source-storage implementation is claimed.** Before implementation, define a private, persistent, non-web-served storage boundary and a stable evidence-ID-to-object mapping. Retrieval must enforce authorization, prevent path traversal, verify the exact byte count and SHA-256 before parsing, and fail closed on missing/changed content. Do not treat a matching hash alone as proof of broker authenticity.
- Next implementation should add a configurable storage adapter and durable object key tied to the evidence record, then authenticated upload/retrieval and integrity tests. Choose the deployment-backed persistent volume only after confirming the Docker/VM volume layout; do not silently store source documents in an ephemeral container filesystem or Git.
- The prior successful PR-head CI run applies to its exact tested commit only; documentation updates require a fresh CI run on the resulting exact head. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

## Phase 3 private contract-note storage implementation — 22 October 2026

- Added a configurable `BROKER_CHARGE_DOCUMENT_ROOT` (default `/var/lib/tradepro/contract-notes`) and a named Docker volume mounted only into backend and worker containers. The volume is not mounted into Nginx or the frontend.
- Added authenticated upload and download endpoints under `/api/v1/broker-charge-evidence`. Upload is restricted to a broker connection owned by the authenticated user, has a 10 MiB limit, uses an application-generated UUID key, records SHA-256, exact byte size, and uploader identity (`received_by_user_id`), and leaves evidence in `RECEIVED` status. It does not auto-review or promote accounting.
- Added a storage service that writes atomically with restrictive directory/file permissions, validates opaque storage keys against path traversal, and verifies both byte count and SHA-256 before returning source bytes. Missing or changed source bytes fail closed.
- Added Alembic revision `202610220011` to add nullable `storage_key` for backwards compatibility with existing evidence metadata; legacy rows without stored source bytes return unavailable rather than pretending the source was verified.
- Added storage-service tests for successful retrieval, tampering, missing documents, invalid/path-traversal keys, empty content, and deletion, plus API tests for owner-scoped upload/download and tamper rejection. **CI and migration upgrade/downgrade checks on the exact latest head remain required before treating the implementation as verified.**
- SHA-256 only establishes byte-for-byte continuity with the recorded upload; it does not establish that the document genuinely originated from the broker. Independent source-component parsing/review, persisted component provenance, full fill-set/amount/currency/rounding reconciliation, and atomic promotion remain later Phase 3 gates.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

## Phase 3 durable source-component provenance — 22 October 2026

- Added `BrokerChargeSourceComponent` and Alembic revision `202610220012` to persist a charge component's evidence ID, exact source SHA-256, component name, INR amount, source page/row locator, extraction method, parser-version field, extracting user, status, reviewer, review timestamp, and review note.
- This first workflow is explicitly **manual transcription**, versioned as `manual-transcription-v1`; it does not claim that a broker-specific parser exists or that the amount was machine-extracted. No PDF/CSV parser or broker document format was assumed.
- Added authenticated endpoints to record a component as `PENDING_REVIEW`, verify the original file's stored fingerprint/size before recording or reviewing, and require a distinct platform administrator (the existing `is_admin` role) to confirm the amount against the original source before it becomes `VERIFIED`. Rejected components remain rejected; duplicate component entries and non-INR currencies fail closed.
- Added API regression tests for pending-before-review behavior, same-user review rejection, distinct-reviewer verification, tampered-source rejection, invalid currency, and duplicate component prevention.
- CI run [39742979087](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39742979087) passed on code head `c1004fb5718592fb76ccf50c4007a0d8aec11fb7`: 542 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed. **This documentation synchronization creates a newer head, so recheck exact-head CI before merge.** This is source-component provenance, not the final reconciliation gate: allocation totals must still match verified source components, exact eligible fill sets, currency, and rounding policy under a transaction before any future promotion is considered.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. All changes target `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, never original `Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 allocation-ledger verification — 22 October 2026

- Added `verify_component_allocation_ledger` as a read-only, fail-closed verifier for a reviewed source component and its pending allocation rows. It rechecks the stored document fingerprint/size and validates component/evidence review provenance.
- Source-component review now persists the canonical sorted eligible trade-record UUID set, its SHA-256 manifest fingerprint, the approved `largest-remainder-v1` method, and the reviewer-approved allocation basis. The reviewer must identify persisted fills from the same broker connection; duplicate/missing/cross-connection IDs are rejected.
- The verifier requires the allocation ledger's exact fill set to equal the reviewed manifest, each source total to equal the independently reviewed component amount, all currencies to match INR, every allocation's method/basis to match the reviewed policy, and the paise-exact allocated sum to equal the source amount. It locks evidence, component, allocation rows, and fill rows for transaction-safe verification.
- This verifier returns `VERIFIED_PENDING_PROMOTION` and does **not** promote allocation statuses. The caller must retain the locks and run any future promotion in the same transaction after rechecking eligibility. Any mismatch fails closed and leaves rows pending.
- Regression tests cover successful verification, fill-set mismatch, source-total mismatch, and source-document tampering. **CI for this latest code/test/doc head is still required before treating Step 3 as verified.**
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled; changes stay exclusively in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.
