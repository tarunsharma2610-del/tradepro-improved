## Phase 3 forward checkpoint — 25 October 2026

- Implementation now preserves additional documented Upstox source labels: `transaction_charges`, `clearing_charges`, `ipft`, `other_charges`, and `demat_transaction_charges`. These are evidence-intake vocabulary only and remain pending independent review.
- The allocation/source-component database constraints were expanded by migration `202610250019`; the API and regression tests cover intake. Live-fill accounting deliberately still requires exactly six reconciled components, so a separately reported IPFT or any extra component fails closed instead of being silently ignored or double-counted.
- Preserve the existing NSE/IPFT calculation: documented combined ₹307/crore versus ₹306.99 transaction + ₹0.01 IPFT yields the same ₹307 base and ₹55.26 GST at 18%. This arithmetic is already tested; it does not prove Upstox endpoint or contract-note field semantics.
- GST component composition remains product-, date- and invoice-dependent. No production tariff or API mapping is approved. Exact-head CI for the new code/migration/test changes is required before this checkpoint is called verified.
- PR #6 remains open/draft/unmerged; PAPER mode remains mandatory; live broker order writes and automatic generic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Work only in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is out of scope.

## Brokerage cap entrypoint integration — 23 October 2026

- The previous exact-head implementation CI passed on commit [3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384): **712 passed, 1 warning**; SQLite/PostgreSQL migration round-trips, broker-write boundary guard, synthetic restore drill and evidence retention also passed.
- Follow-up review found the general `calculate_charge_for_trade` entry point selected an approved brokerage rule but bypassed the rule-bound minimum/maximum caps. Fixed it to route order-notional brokerage through `calculate_order_brokerage`, and added regression test `test_trade_charge_entrypoint_applies_caps_from_selected_brokerage_rule`. Code/test commits: [d6d60a03732ab322785d5e020f0521a4b96162c9](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/d6d60a03732ab322785d5e020f0521a4b96162c9) and [78f5f27135137a1d8f0882d2c0a91d013f6e8556](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/78f5f27135137a1d8f0882d2c0a91d013f6e8556).
- **The entrypoint follow-up has not yet been validated by CI.** Earlier 712-pass results do not cover these later code/test commits. CI for the resulting latest documentation head must complete before this gate is marked green.
- The cap-aware snapshot schema v4 records minimum/maximum values in the snapshot and rule fingerprint; same-event cap changes are conflicting replays. These helper functions do not prove official Upstox rates or legal/tax applicability, and the snapshot builder does not itself persist or promote charges.
- Automatic quantity/notional allocation remains disabled until reviewed, effective-dated component-specific tariff rules exist. Existing variance tests keep estimate-vs-actual comparisons review-only and do not promote charge ledger entries.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle Cloud recovery. All work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is out of scope.

## Rule-bound brokerage caps and passing CI — 23 October 2026

- Order-level brokerage minimum/maximum caps are now fields on the validated `TariffRule`, and are accepted only for order-notional brokerage rules. Caps must be finite, nonnegative, and paise-precise; minimum cannot exceed maximum.
- `calculate_order_brokerage` reads caps from the reviewed rule rather than caller-supplied parameters. Tariff estimate snapshot schema is now v4; snapshots include the cap values and include them in the rule fingerprint. Changing a cap for the same event produces a conflicting replay rather than a silent overwrite.
- Exact-head backend workflow [39976363279](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39976363279) passed on commit [3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384): **712 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence retention passed.
- The warning is a Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning; the workflow also reports Node.js action-runtime deprecation warnings. They did not fail the run. Do not claim that this CI head verifies any later documentation-only commit until CI is checked for that exact head.
- This implementation does not establish official Upstox tariff rates or tax-law applicability; caps/rates must come from a reviewed source record. The snapshot helper itself does not persist estimates or promote them into actual charges. Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle Cloud recovery.
- Next accounting gate: verify aggregate order-level estimate-versus-actual variance handling, then rerun exact-head CI and synchronize all nine documents after any further changes. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order writes remain disabled.
- All work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Brokerage cap precision and CI checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Brokerage minimum and maximum inputs now reject values with more than two decimal places, avoiding sub-paise cap ambiguity. Regression tests cover sub-paise minimum and maximum values.
- Exact-head workflow run [39975215770](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39975215770) passed on commit [d650471895e6938b175434eff20b7d7421abb046](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/d650471895e6938b175434eff20b7d7421abb046): **709 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence retention completed successfully.
- The remaining warning is a third-party `starlette.testclient` / AnyIO deprecation warning; GitHub Actions also emitted Node.js action-runtime deprecation warnings. These did not fail the run and should be tracked separately from accounting correctness.
- The nine project documents are now being synchronized after this green code/test head. A new CI run for the resulting documentation commit is required before claiming that latest documentation head is green.
- This run's restore evidence is synthetic; it does not prove recovery of actual Oracle Cloud production data. Calculation helpers validate structure and precision, not official Upstox rates or legal/tax applicability.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending accounting acceptance review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. All work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Latest Phase 3 CI checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Stamp-duty regression setup was corrected in commit [c98d13d86031ffe173546dbbc9c8b0234e02456e](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/c98d13d86031ffe173546dbbc9c8b0234e02456e): invalid-basis test cases now explicitly select the intended `BUY` transaction side so each case reaches the basis guard it is designed to exercise.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39974055917](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39974055917) passed on that code/test commit: **707 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence retention all passed.
- Existing tests already cover inclusive effective-date boundaries, expiry of old tariff rules, overlapping approved-rule rejection, deterministic largest-remainder paise allocation, input-order independence, zero-weight residual handling, and exact source-total reconciliation. Do not duplicate these tests; review whether the rules are wired into real reviewed component-specific tariff selection before enabling automatic allocation.
- Brokerage and GST calculation helpers and stamp-duty side/product/base guards are arithmetic safeguards only. They do not establish official Upstox tariff rates or tax-law applicability. Authentic contract-note verification and actual Oracle Cloud backup recovery remain separate evidence/deployment gates.
- The documentation files are being synchronized after this green code/test head. Rerun CI on the resulting latest documentation commit before claiming the complete latest head is green.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending accounting acceptance review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Work is exclusively in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Phase 3 — durable per-fill charge allocation verification — 23 October 2026

- Latest test refinement commit: [e73c9cbb8b5c4e34abe9874b548dbae5cbf762af](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/e73c9cbb8b5c4e34abe9874b548dbae5cbf762af). The PostgreSQL concurrency test now only treats the expected `ValueError` for pending/unreconciled allocation rows as a valid fail-closed outcome; unexpected exceptions fail the test.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39971530839](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39971530839) passed: **688 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration round-trip, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and retained restore evidence all passed.
- This run validates synthetic test fixtures and restore mechanics only. It does not validate an authentic personal Upstox contract note or prove restoration of the user's actual Oracle Cloud backup.
- The nine required project documents are being synchronized after this green code/test head; rerun CI on the resulting latest documentation commit before calling the documentation checkpoint current.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending complete accounting/idempotency review and explicit user approval. Live broker order submission remains disabled. All work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Current acceptance clarification — 23 October 2026

- **Public contract-note research is complete for development:** third-party examples dated 12 March 2025 and 21 May 2024, plus a sample-note guide, were reviewed for structure and charge categories. See `docs/UPSTOX_CONTRACT_NOTE_AND_API_EVIDENCE.md`.
- The examples are not independently authenticated. No raw public document, personal identifier, or invented “real” evidence is stored in this repository. The checked-in Upstox-style fixture remains explicitly synthetic.
- **A personal/account-specific contract note is not required to continue or complete Phase 3 engineering.** It remains optional future validation for account-specific source authenticity and charge comparison; public aggregate figures must not be treated as proof of per-fill amounts.
- A separate real retained database/document backup and restore test remains a deployment/operational acceptance gate for the Oracle Free Cloud environment. Synthetic CI restore results do not prove recovery of real user data.
- Exact-head CI on commit `18c897a282ea5f8e7c6a55707ad24b6cf8da5b27` passed in [run 39915983869](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39915983869). This does not substitute for the next CI run after this documentation clarification.
- This section supersedes older checkpoint wording below that may imply a personal contract note is required before Phase 3 engineering can proceed. Historical notes remain for audit traceability.
- Scope: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order writes remain disabled.

---

## Phase 3 allocation-weight integrity checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Code review found that a charge ledger could sum to the correct source total while its individual per-fill amounts did not follow the reviewed allocation basis. Reconciliation now recomputes and verifies each fill's expected amount before promotion.
- Added migration `202610230013` and persisted canonical reviewer-approved weights for `EXPLICIT_REVIEWED`. Source review requires one weight per eligible fill; `QUANTITY` and `NOTIONAL` bases derive weights from persisted broker-trade quantity and price. The verifier checks the complete fill set, basis, method, total, and each per-fill allocation.
- Added regression coverage for a tampered per-fill split that preserves the aggregate total.
- Exact-head CI [run 39912330029](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39912330029) passed on code commit `776ee59485d79b880d7aee0f5c3ecb641eb7db3f`: **567 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore all passed.
- This CI result validates that code commit only; the documentation commits now being synchronized require a new exact-head run. Synthetic restore evidence is not proof of recovery of actual Oracle Free Cloud data or authenticity of a real Upstox contract note.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending the final review and explicit user approval. Live broker writes remain disabled. Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 promotion rollback guard — 22 October 2026

- Exact-head CI run [39813721425](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39813721425) **PASSED** on commit `121741f32ff74c46ccc059f672b3e9f0e020ef14`: backend pytest **565 passed, 1 warning**; configured PostgreSQL 16 migration/safety checks completed successfully.
- Added a regression test that injects a flush failure during charge-allocation promotion and verifies that, after rollback/reload, all allocation rows remain `PENDING_RECONCILIATION` with no reconciliation reference.
- This CI result validates the above commit only. Any subsequent documentation commits require a fresh exact-head run.
- PR #6 remains open, draft, and unmerged pending continued accounting review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled.
- Synthetic restore evidence does not prove recovery of the user's real Oracle Free Cloud data or authenticity of a real broker contract note. Real-data acceptance remains deferred until the user supplies the evidence.
- Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. Do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 exact-head CI checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Backend CI passed on commit `1fcbb06a78fd06226f0e0e6438cf72b422dc2d4e`: **563 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks, and the isolated synthetic database/document-volume restore drill all passed.
- This result validates that code commit only. Documentation changes require exact-head CI again.
- Synthetic restore evidence does not prove recovery of real Oracle Free Cloud data or authenticity of a real broker contract note.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending accounting/idempotency review and explicit user approval. Live broker writes remain disabled.
- Real contract-note and retained real-backup/restore evidence remain pending; the user plans to provide these later.
- Repository scope is `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. Do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 source-reconciliation safety correction — 22 October 2026

- Code review identified a safety gap in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py`: the service previously marked rows `RECONCILED` merely because calculated allocations summed to the caller-provided component total. That is arithmetic reconciliation, not independent verification of a broker contract-note source total.
- Fixed in commit `fce01b98ce33760e3361991e8d2ffba01b0ad281`: newly persisted allocations remain `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`; this service clears the reconciliation reference and does not promote them to `RECONCILED`. A separate source-verification workflow must establish provenance and validate the source component total before promotion.
- Updated regression expectation in commit `8c38ab8ecc8114f392e11ea988ac25c3d7c8e2df` to assert pending status and no reconciliation reference even when arithmetic totals match.
- **CI pending:** the code/test commits and documentation commits need a fresh exact-head run. Do not describe this correction as verified until CI passes.
- This deliberately fails closed: matching a number supplied by the caller is not treated as proof that it came from an authentic contract note. Contract-note authenticity/parser, component-specific allocation methodology, source-total verification, and controlled accounting integration remain open Phase 3 gates.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged pending exact-head CI and broader review. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 allocation edge-case hardening — 22 October 2026

- Code review found a rounding edge case in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_service.py`: when a source total was one paise and a zero-weight fill ID sorted before positive-weight IDs, the deterministic largest-remainder tie-break could assign that paise to a fill whose weight was zero.
- Fixed in commit `1f04b5d0c0fc07af15eadd4fe7c70f14ff054f91`: only strictly positive-weight fills participate in residual ranking. Zero-weight fills remain in the result at INR 0.00.
- Added regression coverage in commit `347f9588485bd7452d949dd816ba6966196354f6` for the one-paise/tied-remainder case and the two-paise case.
- **Verification pending:** CI for these code/test commits and the following documentation commits must pass on the exact latest branch head before this fix is called verified. The prior PostgreSQL concurrency success does not include this new change.
- Existing successful PostgreSQL concurrency run: `39737580271` on `d59e7d8`, `527 passed, 1 warning`, with `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` set. New allocation edge-case fix is a separate code change and needs fresh CI.
- Source authenticity, component-appropriate allocation policy, exact source-total reconciliation against real contract-note data, and accounting integration remain release gates. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 PostgreSQL concurrency verification — 22 October 2026

- **Verified green:** GitHub Actions run `39737580271`, commit `d59e7d8a613471c3134b8d0c6dcdb326713ce7eb`, completed successfully. Job `Backend pytest` passed; log summary: `527 passed, 1 warning in 32.20s`.
- The test job environment explicitly set `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` to the dedicated PostgreSQL 16 service. The suite reported no skipped tests, so the opt-in PostgreSQL integration test was not skipped in this run.
- The preceding fixture corrections addressed (1) missing `Base` import and (2) parent user row not flushed before dependent records. The subsequent exact-head run is green.
- This is evidence that the new PostgreSQL concurrency integration test completed successfully in the suite. Keep its specific invariant documented: competing independent sessions target one evidence/component with different fill sets; only one allocation should persist, without partial/mixed rows.
- Remaining gates are not closed by this test: authenticated contract-note provenance/schema, reviewed charge-component allocation methodology and residual handling, reconciliation against source totals, and controlled integration with live-fill accounting still need review/acceptance. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending review of the full change and its broader release gates.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## PostgreSQL concurrency-test fixture correction — 22 October 2026

- Inspected failed workflow `39737225306` on commit `d6a9cab`. PostgreSQL test failed during fixture setup, before the race assertion: the `broker_connections.user_id` foreign key referenced a user not yet flushed to PostgreSQL. The suite result was `1 failed, 526 passed, 1 warning`.
- Fixed in code commit `0c4d5133a1224fbac5b0eb2cafb3b7c195612d40`: explicitly flush the user parent row before adding dependent portfolio/instrument/connection rows. No production behavior was changed.
- **Pending:** exact-head CI for `0c4d513` and subsequent documentation commits. Do not infer that the concurrency test passes from this fixture correction alone.
- Acceptance remains: on PostgreSQL, two independent sessions race different fill sets against the same evidence/component; exactly one complete allocation set succeeds, the other fails closed, and no partial/mixed ledger remains.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged until this test and exact-head CI pass. Contract-note authenticity, allocation methodology review, and accounting integration remain separate gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## PostgreSQL concurrency-test CI correction — 22 October 2026

- First run of the new integration test failed before reaching the race assertion: `NameError: Base is not defined` in test schema setup. Suite result was `1 failed, 526 passed, 1 warning` on commit `1859179`.
- Fixed by importing `Base` from `app.core.database` in commit `eb4b6c4`. This is a test setup correction only; it does not weaken production checks.
- **Pending verification:** CI for `eb4b6c4` and the documentation commits is not yet confirmed green. The PostgreSQL test's runtime race behavior remains unverified until it executes successfully against the CI PostgreSQL 16 service.
- The test provisions isolated records and races two independent sessions against one evidence/component. Acceptance criterion: exactly one allocation request succeeds, the other fails closed, and exactly one allocation row remains.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until exact-head CI passes and the concurrency result is inspected. Evidence authenticity, valid charge basis, and integration with live accounting remain separate gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 PostgreSQL concurrency test added — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`, an opt-in integration test that uses `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`, two independent SQLAlchemy sessions and concurrent threads to race incompatible single-fill allocations against one reviewed evidence record/component. The expected result is exactly one winner and one persisted allocation, with no mixed/partial fill set.
- The existing `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` provisions PostgreSQL 16 and exports `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`; the integration test creates ORM metadata in that dedicated CI test database because pytest runs before the later Alembic migration verification step.
- Test setup was corrected to build the required portfolio → instrument → order → broker-order → broker-trade foreign-key chain. Test commits: `a69e083`, `4b5e8cc`, `1859179`.
- **Pending:** this new PostgreSQL concurrency test has not yet been confirmed green by exact-head CI. A green prior run does not cover these commits. If CI fails, inspect the test output and correct the fixture or concurrency assumptions before claiming safety.
- The evidence-row `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` is the serialization point. This integration test is the empirical verification needed; SQLite-only unit tests are insufficient.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending successful exact-head CI and review. Contract-note authenticity, component-appropriate allocation basis and live accounting integration remain separate release gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 continuation — PostgreSQL concurrency test still required — 22 October 2026

- Latest confirmed successful workflow remains `39735969492` on commit `a94760f66d5405a563cca25960c95f00ba2a4e5f`; it is a PR-triggered backend-tests run. No later code change is represented by that result.
- Rechecked the allocation persistence service and test setup. The default test fixture explicitly forces SQLite in-memory; it does not exercise PostgreSQL row locks. The workflow file is named `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` (not `ci.yml`).
- Source evidence is locked with SQLAlchemy `with_for_update()` before fill rows and existing allocations are queried. This is a plausible PostgreSQL serialization point but is not yet race-tested with two independent transactions.
- Next step remains an opt-in integration test using a dedicated PostgreSQL test database/URL and two independent sessions racing different fill sets against the same evidence/component. The test must assert one complete winner and one fail-closed conflict, with no partial rows. CI must provision PostgreSQL or clearly report the integration test as skipped; a skipped test is not proof of safety.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged pending that test and exact-head green CI. Source document authenticity, allocation-basis review and accounting-service integration remain separate release gates. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- All changes in this project remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 checkpoint — concurrency safeguard and verification boundary — 22 October 2026

- Confirmed latest recorded successful GitHub Actions run for this branch: `39735332590`, commit `9ed382f5872faaf2c20f71e4292ac5cc3baf322f` (backend tests, success).
- The source-evidence `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock is implemented in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py` before fill-set lookup/allocation persistence. This is intended to serialize concurrent allocations for the same evidence on PostgreSQL.
- **Important verification limit:** the green run is for commit `9ed382f`; it does not include any later changes. The current test file still lacks a PostgreSQL-backed concurrent allocation test. Do not claim race-safety has been empirically proven until that test runs against PostgreSQL with two independent sessions/transactions.
- Next implementation step: add an opt-in integration test using a dedicated PostgreSQL test URL (e.g. `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`) that starts two transactions attempting incompatible fill sets against one evidence/component; verify the second waits/re-reads the ledger and fails closed without partial rows. If CI does not provide a PostgreSQL service for pytest, add a dedicated PostgreSQL test job rather than treating SQLite `FOR UPDATE` behavior as equivalent.
- After the test, run full exact-head CI, inspect logs, and update this checkpoint with the observed result. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until verified.
- Charge-note authenticity, appropriate per-component allocation methodology, and accounting-service integration remain review gates. No automatic accounting promotion or live broker submission is enabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 concurrent allocation serialization — 22 October 2026

- Latest previously verified CI head `9e07a5c95401ab3ccfd6c32a8223721dd573b928` passed, including backend pytest, broker write-boundary enforcement, and Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade on SQLite and PostgreSQL 16.
- Code commit `34dd6cebb424f50963a3ca788de37490d39bdb60` adds a row-level lock on the reviewed `BrokerChargeEvidence` record before locking fill rows and inspecting/inserting component allocations. Rationale: locking only the target fills does not serialize two concurrent requests using disjoint fill sets against the same evidence/component; both could otherwise observe an empty ledger and insert different subsets. PostgreSQL's evidence-row lock provides a per-source serialization point.
- **Pending validation:** run exact-head CI for `34dd6ce` and the documentation commits. SQLite does not enforce `FOR UPDATE`; green SQLite tests alone are not proof of concurrency behavior. Add or run a PostgreSQL-backed concurrent test before treating race safety as fully verified.
- No live accounting promotion was enabled. Evidence authenticity and the economic correctness of a selected allocation basis remain review-gated.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. All changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

## Replay-basis test correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest CI failed on head `bac124af41342293e5bceba8d5641e85184bee16`: `525 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning`. The new test supplied `ALTERNATE_REVIEWED`, which is intentionally not a supported allocation basis; validation rejected it before replay-conflict detection.
- Test-only correction committed as `6b91827d6a4a01ea93009d664d467ca32d5ec342`: the test now uses `QUANTITY`, a supported basis distinct from the original `EXPLICIT_REVIEWED`, so it exercises the intended changed-basis replay guard without weakening production validation.
- **Pending:** exact-head CI for `6b91827` and documentation updates must pass before replay-basis coverage is marked green.
- Concurrency review remains open: unique evidence/trade/component rows protect duplicate per-fill rows, but do not alone prove correct handling of concurrent conflicting fill sets. PostgreSQL integration coverage is required.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 rollback CI verified; replay-basis test added — 22 October 2026

- CI run `39734057700` passed for commit `85e022e630682da50b1b9e906a8b5986e541d97b`. This confirms the explicit SQLite transaction-boundary correction fixed the rollback test on that head.
- Added a new regression test to reject a replay that changes the reviewed allocation basis, while preserving the existing exact-replay behavior. Test commits: `3f912a1b02cea3880cd7020dea88fa9cbf1185f9` and helper correction `25695e5fc6a1d65f9344bd44f3229c9fa90a69a0`.
- **Pending verification:** the new replay-basis test and following documentation commits have not yet passed exact-head CI. Do not count them as green until CI completes.
- Concurrency note: the model has a unique constraint on evidence + trade + component, which prevents duplicate rows for a fill, but it does not by itself serialize concurrent requests that race with different fill sets. Before merge, add/review a database-backed concurrency strategy and test on PostgreSQL; SQLite alone cannot prove row-lock semantics.
- Still not proven: contract-note authenticity, legally/economically appropriate allocation basis, and integration with live accounting. No automatic accounting promotion is enabled.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Work remains confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## SQLite rollback test infrastructure correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest exact-head CI `39733775193` failed again: `524 passed, 1 failed`. The explicit session transaction still did not roll back the rows because SQLite's legacy driver transaction mode did not issue a physical `BEGIN` before the service's nested SAVEPOINT.
- Test-only infrastructure correction committed as `d49e3cdfae519dc7d7f80bdcda882fcaa6842c51`: configure the in-memory SQLite test engine with explicit transaction boundaries (disable driver-managed implicit transaction control and emit `BEGIN` on SQLAlchemy's begin event). This is the documented SQLAlchemy pattern for reliable SAVEPOINT behavior; it changes test setup, not production database code.
- **Pending:** rerun CI for this commit and documentation updates; only mark rollback coverage resolved if the test passes.
- If the rollback test still fails, stop and replace it with a database-specific integration test rather than weakening the assertion. Concurrent conflicting replay tests remain next after green CI.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

## Rollback-test CI failure and correction — 22 October 2026

- CI run `39733515473` failed at commit `c9adf3b9da90e1a2d350c216ccdb923ac3ba41a8`: **524 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning**. The only failure was the new rollback test, which assumed the shared SQLite test session had a real outer transaction. The fixture commits setup records, and SQLite can release a SAVEPOINT without an explicit outer `BEGIN`.
- Corrective test commit: `f941b4bf32c8be77ad4c8c17811632ed77b540f0`. The test now starts an explicit outer transaction around the allocation service and rolls that transaction back before asserting no allocation rows remain. This tests caller-owned transaction rollback instead of relying on SQLite's implicit transaction behavior.
- **Pending verification:** exact-head CI for `f941b4b` and the documentation commits must pass before this rollback regression is considered resolved.
- No application transaction semantics were changed by this test-only correction. The service still leaves commit/rollback to its caller. Remaining follow-up: concurrent conflicting replay tests and database-level serialization review.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 rollback test checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Exact-head CI verified green for the corrected connection-safety assertion and latest documentation head `a19313ccba7c2fe79c6ac588d3acb81cd4168dce`; run `39733212480` and latest docs run `39733267668` both completed successfully.
- Added `test_outer_transaction_rollback_removes_all_new_allocations` in commit `c9adf3b9da90e1a2d350c216ccdb923ac3ba41a8`. It confirms the persistence service does not commit on the caller's behalf and a caller rollback removes all allocation rows created in that transaction.
- **Pending:** run exact-head CI for the rollback test and subsequent documentation commits. Do not count this new test as passed until the run succeeds.
- Remaining review: database-level uniqueness already guards duplicate evidence/trade/component rows; simultaneous imports can still require stronger serialization/unique source-component identity and explicit conflicting concurrent replay coverage. Source-document authenticity and allocation-basis suitability remain manual/review-gated; no accounting promotion is wired.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged and live broker submission/automatic accounting promotion gated. Changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Follow-up CI diagnosis — 22 October 2026

- The corrected-fixture CI run `39732808218` failed after executing the tests: **523 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning**. The remaining failure was an overly specific expected error-message regex in the cross-connection rejection test; the service correctly rejected the trade with `Every broker trade record must belong to the evidence connection.`
- Fix committed as `6ff7d5bfc442f7fa06f6df9299b23199faf04d3d`: align the assertion with the service's actual safety error. This is a test assertion correction, not a relaxation of the connection guard.
- The exact-head CI for `6ff7d5b` must be checked before declaring the regression resolved.
- Next after CI passes: add explicit rollback coverage, then review concurrent/replayed allocation behavior and database constraints. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until the full required checks pass.
- Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.

---

## CI failure analysis and correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest persistence-test CI failed on commit `f7d84cd695192e59bee12f1de625e570746a2e88`: backend pytest reported `519 passed, 1 warning, 5 errors`.
- Root cause from the job log: all five new persistence tests requested a `reviewed_evidence` fixture that did not exist. This was test setup failure, not evidence that the allocation assertions passed.
- Corrective commit `a1149cbff48357fd9aab006de7fe3435a89cbed0` adds a local fixture creating a user, broker connection, and reviewed contract-note evidence row using the actual model fields. The new commit must still pass exact-head CI before this issue can be considered resolved.
- Next: verify CI for the corrected head. If green, add rollback and concurrency/replay tests. If it fails, inspect job logs and fix before proceeding.
- No merge; no live-accounting promotion. Work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 persistence-test checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added database-backed tests for successful component allocation and exact source-total reconciliation, idempotent identical replay, conflicting replay with changed total, cross-connection trade rejection, and changed fill-set rejection without partial rows.
- Tests use the existing isolated SQLAlchemy test-session fixture. They are committed to the Phase 3 branch; exact-head CI for this test commit and the documentation commits still needs verification.
- Review note: the current persistence service marks a component `RECONCILED` as soon as stored allocations sum to the source total. This is arithmetic reconciliation only, not proof that the chosen allocation basis is correct or the source document is authentic. No live-fill accounting promotion is wired to it.
- **Next:** verify exact-head CI; fix test/migration issues. Then add explicit transaction rollback coverage and consider DB-level concurrency/idempotency enforcement for simultaneous identical/conflicting imports before any merge.
- Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. All changes are confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 transactional allocation persistence checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py` to validate reviewed contract-note evidence, enforce that every referenced persisted broker trade belongs to the same broker connection, and persist per-fill component allocations in a database savepoint.
- Replay handling: identical replay requests return the existing allocation rows; changed fill sets, totals, allocation values, basis, method version, currency, or rejected rows fail closed. Allocations are marked `RECONCILED` only when the full fill set exists and the sum equals the source component total exactly.
- This service uses the existing deterministic largest-remainder utility and writes a reconciliation reference. It does not authenticate the original contract-note document, choose an economically/legal basis, parse broker files, or enable accounting promotion.
- **Validation still required:** exact-head CI and DB-backed integration tests for successful allocation, identical replay, conflicting replay, cross-connection fill rejection, partial failure rollback, and migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade. Treat the implementation as unverified until those pass.
- **Next:** run CI, add database-backed persistence tests and repair issues found; then review concurrency/idempotency behavior and synchronize the PR description/docs. Do not merge until exact-head CI is green.
- Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. Changes remain limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 allocation-math checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_service.py` with deterministic largest-remainder allocation math using Decimal values and integer paise, stable fill-ID tie-breaking, explicit method version, and source-total equality check.
- Added regression tests for source-total reconciliation, input-order independence, tie-breaking, zero weights, invalid/negative/non-finite values, unsupported basis, and paise precision.
- **Important limitation:** this is a pure allocation-math utility, not yet the durable persistence/orchestration service. It does not read reviewed evidence, bind trade rows to a connection, write immutable ledger rows, reconcile stored component totals across all fills, or gate execution promotion. A caller must select an explicitly reviewed basis appropriate to the charge component; no basis is inferred here.
- Existing schema migration/model slice had CI success at PR head `1505b71198f7f9f42ad749588597b7c8bb63eb0d`, run [39730707245](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39730707245). The newer service/tests/docs commits still require exact-head CI verification.
- **Next:** verify latest CI and correct failures; then implement a transactional persistence service that validates reviewed evidence + same-connection trades, inserts replay-safe rows, and marks a component reconciled only when the allocations sum exactly to its source total. Add DB-backed tests for idempotency, conflicting replays, foreign-connection evidence/trades, and rollback.
- Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. All work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` must remain untouched.

## Phase 3 allocation-ledger implementation checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation` (based on verified main `54342a69249c9a790544c415842ec74c9ddf57fb`).
- **Initial implementation slice:** added `BrokerChargeAllocation` model and migration `202610220010`, registered the model, and added schema-contract tests. Ledger fields capture source evidence, broker connection, broker trade record, charge component, source component total, allocated amount in INR paise precision, allocation basis, method version, reconciliation state, and an optional reconciliation reference.
- **Idempotency constraint:** unique `(evidence_id, broker_trade_record_id, charge_component)`; supported components and nonnegative amounts are database-constrained. New rows default to `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`.
- **Not yet complete:** this is the durable schema foundation only. There is not yet a persistence/allocation service, cross-record validation that evidence and trade belong to the same connection, immutable-update enforcement, deterministic rounding/residual algorithm, source-total reconciliation, or linkage to execution promotion. Do not claim live accounting is using this ledger.
- **Verification:** exact-head CI has not yet been observed for this branch. Do not merge until backend tests and SQLite/PostgreSQL migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks pass.
- **Next:** validate migration/tests, add a service that uses Decimal/paise arithmetic only when an explicitly reviewed basis is authorized, enforces evidence/connection/trade binding and replay-safe inserts, and reconciles each source component total exactly. Ambiguous allocations must remain pending and block promotion.
- **Safety/scope:** keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. All changes are limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## Latest verified Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Code/test commit:** `42a7418c674d92af9d099b1095d90af660678e2b` on `phase3/reviewed-charge-evidence-gate` in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.
- **Exact-head CI:** GitHub Actions run [39638875688](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39638875688) completed successfully. Backend pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, and PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passed.
- **New regression coverage:** rejects charge evidence from non-contract-note sources and mismatched reviewer identities. Existing evidence validation covers connection binding, reference matching, reviewed status, reviewer identity and review timestamp.
- **Scope and safety:** PR #5 remains open and unmerged as of this checkpoint. Evidence metadata/hash and a review status are provenance/workflow controls, not cryptographic proof of broker authenticity. Contract-note parsing/import, immutable per-fill charge allocation, deterministic paise rounding/residual handling, source-total reconciliation, and complete replay/partial-fill/crash-recovery acceptance remain unfinished.
- **Next:** continue with a reviewed contract-note import boundary and a durable, idempotent per-fill allocation ledger; do not invent charge splits. Keep live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling disabled until release gates pass.
- **Repository constraint:** changes must remain in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository.

<!-- Authoritative checkpoint refresh: 21 October 2026. Scope: tradepro-improved only. -->

## Authoritative Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Current code-and-documentation HEAD before this documentation sync:** `4fe58dd11b018d1f85000540ad2ec1b7f6f52ae5`. Its exact-HEAD push CI [run 39633514414](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633514414) completed successfully. Backend pytest, broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade-downgrade-reupgrade checks all passed.
- **Evidence-ledger implementation:** `6c0a382eb9fea7f386433cfdb65a65cbc53f218e`; migration correction: `c17f522bf68121a6d162a4d858cd9de8b95d45d1`. Their CI runs [39633266180](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633266180) and [39633330531](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633330531) both passed.
- **Implemented:** `BrokerChargeEvidence` model and migration `202610210009`; captures broker connection, report metadata, filename, SHA-256 fingerprint, byte size, parser version, and review status. Tests cover persistence, duplicate-fingerprint rejection per connection, and database constraints.
- **Limits:** a hash detects byte-level changes but does not prove broker origin. The ledger does not yet retain document bytes, import/parse the broker document, establish authenticity, or allocate charge components to fills. `REVIEWED` is a workflow status, not automatic approval to promote live accounting.
- **Next Phase 3 gate:** build a fail-closed, idempotent contract-note import/review boundary and inspect a real redacted broker contract note before selecting charge-specific allocation rules. Then implement immutable per-fill allocation records, paise rounding/residual rules, source-total reconciliation, and replay/crash/partial-fill tests.
- **Phase 3 remains in progress.** Keep live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling disabled. Phase 2 remains closed. All changes must stay in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- Older checkpoints below are historical; this section is authoritative until replaced by a later verified checkpoint.

Verify the exact HEAD's CI before treating the documentation checkpoint as fully green.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Latest verified code/test HEAD:** `3963c2bf4e6ffe2bb33d327b10e2995cd243d003`. Exact-head [Backend CI run 39607630055](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39607630055) passed **484 tests, 1 warning in 29.34s**; the broker-write boundary guard passed, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- New Phase 3 guard: broker-reported live-fill charge references are trimmed for storage and rejected when longer than the `Execution.charge_reference` 200-character column limit. This prevents a predictable storage error from being misreported as a concurrent promotion conflict. Regression coverage is included in the 484-test result.
- The existing Phase 3 safety gates remain active: replay must match the accounted fill and exact charge evidence; only broker-reported, internally consistent charges with a non-empty audit reference are accepted; durable staged trade quantities must match broker-confirmed child fills before promotion; exchange-time ambiguity/out-of-order fills fail closed; paper positions and cash remain isolated.
- **Phase 3 remains in progress, not complete.** Remaining review includes coordinator/identity boundaries, charge provenance/allocation semantics, full partial-fill and crash/restart acceptance criteria, and any explicitly selected bridge design. Keep `BrokerFillIdentity` separate from manual `BrokerTradeRecord` unless a reviewed Phase 3 design explicitly authorizes a narrow bridge.
- Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository remains untouched. Phase 2 remains closed.
- This checkpoint describes the verified code commit above. The documentation synchronization commit will trigger its own CI; do not treat that documentation commit as green until its exact-head run passes. Older checkpoint entries below are historical audit trail, not current status.

- The Phase 2 audit covers the dependency/port matrix, broker-fill workflow boundary, idempotency and rollback, reconciliation crash recovery, transaction-level lease fencing, slow persistence, 20 concurrent expiry-boundary renewal/reclaim races, and official Upstox current-day API semantics.
- Official Upstox V2 [order-book](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-order-book/) and [get-trades-for-day](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-history/) endpoints are current-day endpoints without documented pagination parameters. Historical trades use a separate [paginated API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-historical-trades/); it is not wired into the Phase 2 worker.
- **Phase 2 technical checklist is complete.** Before any Phase 3 work, require a passing exact-head CI run for the then-current `main` and explicit user approval; never infer a later commit is green from an earlier run.
- Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling remain disabled. The original `Tradepro` repository remains untouched.

# Tradepro Improved

A separate improvement track for Tradepro. The original `Tradepro` repository and its `main` branch remain untouched.

## Safety-first development rules

- Preserve existing functionality while fixing verified defects.
- Keep paper trading as the default mode.
- Keep live trading disabled until broker execution, order reconciliation, duplicate-order prevention, risk limits, and an emergency kill switch are implemented and tested.
- Never commit API tokens, OAuth secrets, passwords, or other credentials.
- Validate changes with automated tests and build checks before deploying.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current Phase 2 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- Reconciliation crash recovery and transaction-level lease fencing have passed backend CI on the recorded checkpoint (470 tests, 1 warning, broker-write guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles).
- Latest test commit [e56bf4c66f74b875a3ba8fe388138a9d688dd1e2](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/e56bf4c66f74b875a3ba8fe388138a9d688dd1e2) adds failed-commit rollback coverage. Exact-head backend CI [run 39564568154](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39564568154) passed 471 tests (1 warning), broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles. Documentation HEAD `adb69aeb05b70ba4fa9095fc73d9dea033d31eec` also passed backend CI [run 39565251793](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39565251793).
- Phase 2 is in final documentation verification: code/test HEAD `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f` passed [CI run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386) with 472 tests, source guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks. The documentation sync must pass its own exact-head CI before closure. Intent-based BrokerFillIdentity and manual BrokerTradeRecord remain separate; live submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling remain disabled. See MASTER_ROADMAP.md and SAFETY_BRANCH_PORT_MATRIX.md for authoritative scope.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current status

The original source tree has been imported into this repository. Recent improvements include:
- A dashboard at `/` with portfolio summaries and navigation.
- Backend input validation for orders and rejection of invalid broker prices.
- One-time, expiring broker OAuth state backed by a database nonce digest.
- Paper LIMIT-order matching in the worker, using the shared transaction-cost, cash and position accounting.
- Automated backend and frontend checks in GitHub Actions.
- An environment-controlled emergency kill switch blocks new strategy entries when `AUTOMATED_ENTRIES_ENABLED=false`; strategy exits remain enabled.

See [AUDIT_REPORT.md](./AUDIT_REPORT.md) for findings, verification links and remaining work. See [REFERENCE_REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md](./REFERENCE_REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md) for the external repository comparison and safe integration plan.

## Important trading behavior

- **Paper market orders:** use a current Upstox quote for the simulated fill; the application does not invent a price when the quote is unavailable or invalid. The quote parser requires the exact requested instrument key and will not substitute another instrument's price if that key is missing.
- **Paper limit orders:** remain pending until the worker checks them during market hours (about every 5 minutes). A BUY can fill when LTP is at or below its limit; a SELL can fill when LTP is at or above its limit. The matcher uses the shared accounting engine, checks available cash / delivery holdings, and users can cancel pending orders from the portfolio order history.
- **Emergency kill switch:** set `AUTOMATED_ENTRIES_ENABLED=false` in the backend environment and restart the API/worker to stop automated strategy entries. Existing strategy exits are intentionally not blocked. This switch does not stop manual paper orders.
- **Live trading:** is **not implemented** by the shared execution service. Phase 1 has durable intent/idempotency/outbox storage; Phase 2 has pure order/trade normalization, strict local-intent matching, versioned status persistence and idempotent individual fill identity persistence. These do not fetch broker data, aggregate partial fills into account accounting, or submit/cancel orders. Setting `TRADING_MODE=LIVE` is not sufficient to make real broker orders happen; do not treat this repository as ready for live trading.
- **Portfolio settings:** each portfolio has a manual settings form for renaming and optional risk controls: maximum daily realized loss, estimated open exposure, per-order value, simultaneous open/pending positions and orders per day. Controls are disabled until enabled. Limits are checked for paper manual and strategy orders; closing/reducing orders are allowed. Exposure is a conservative cost-basis estimate, not broker margin.
- **Upstox WebSocket:** authenticated endpoints are POST /api/v1/market-data/stream, GET /api/v1/market-data/stream, and DELETE /api/v1/market-data/stream. The portfolio order form has Start/Stop controls for the selected instrument and displays fresh LTP updates. Subscribe only to active catalog keys. Streams are process-local and disappear on API restart; use one API worker until a shared stream/cache layer is added. ExecutionService uses fresh stream ticks when available and otherwise falls back to REST.
- **Instrument sync:** admin POST /api/v1/instruments/sync now reconciles absent/expired instruments only after a completeness gate passes. A separate GitHub Actions workflow successfully downloaded the real official Upstox master and synced it into temporary in-memory SQLite (123,930 active instruments); it never touched production.
- **Migration/deployment:** the portfolio-risk migration is CI-tested on clean SQLite. Back up the deployed database and verify alembic upgrade head in staging before deploying to an existing database.
- **Remaining work:** broker reads/worker and full reconciliation (including fill-vs-intent economic validation, partial-fill aggregation/accounting and out-of-order updates), live order placement, a global account-level live-trading kill switch, exchange holiday calendar, real authenticated WebSocket verification with a user OAuth session, multi-worker stream sharing, and staging migration verification. Live trading is not implemented and must remain disabled.


## Verified status — 17 October 2026
- Latest backend CI after documentation updates: [run 39039714203](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39039714203) — **203 tests passed, 1 warning**; clean SQLite Alembic migration verification passed.
- Safety regression coverage includes exact-instrument quote matching, portfolio order-count cap, incomplete instrument snapshot rejection, WebSocket silence reconnect, and V3 authorization URL validation.
- Official Upstox instrument master was downloaded and synchronized into a disposable in-memory SQLite database: **123,930 active instruments** ([verification workflow](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39037390129)). This did not modify production data.
- Frontend TypeScript/build verification for the stream controls passed ([run 39037642093](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39037642093)).
- **Not production-ready for live trading:** real OAuth WebSocket verification, multi-worker stream sharing, backup-safe staging migration, idempotent live submission and broker reconciliation remain open. Keep live trading disabled; no live orders have been submitted.


## Live-order idempotency and reconciliation — design review (17 October 2026)

The approved live-trading design is now in **Phase 1 implementation** (durable records/repository safeguards only). See [`LIVE_ORDER_IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION.md`](LIVE_ORDER_IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION.md) for the detailed architecture, implementation sequence and acceptance tests.

The design requires durable idempotency keys, payload-hash conflict detection, a committed intent/outbox before broker I/O, explicit UNKNOWN state after ambiguous submissions, broker order/trade reconciliation, fill deduplication, risk rechecks and an account-level emergency stop. Upstox order tags are for correlation/history lookup; the project does not assume they guarantee broker-side idempotency.

**Live broker submission and reconciliation are still not implemented.** Phase 1 adds only durable records/repository safeguards; the shared execution service still creates PAPER orders, live submission remains disabled, no production migration ran and no real orders were submitted. Do not set `TRADING_MODE=LIVE` or connect the paper path to the live broker method. Latest Phase 1 code CI: [run 39048147046](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39048147046), 215 tests passed, 1 warning; simultaneous idempotency requests passed against PostgreSQL 16, and Alembic upgrade → downgrade → re-upgrade passed on both SQLite and PostgreSQL 16.


## Project roadmap
See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the phased implementation plan, verified status, release gates and the evidence required before live trading can be considered.


## Live-order safety development status — 17 October 2026
- Phase 1 durable intent/idempotency storage and Phase 2 pure broker-order normalization + strict intent-matching helpers are CI-tested.
- Latest Phase 2 matching test checkpoint: [GitHub Actions run 39050424898](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39050424898), 255 passed, 1 warning, including SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- The helpers do not make broker API calls and do not persist reconciled states or import fills. Live order submission/cancellation remains unavailable and disabled.


### Phase 2 reconciliation repository update — 17 October 2026
- A repository-only versioned transition now persists a validated normalized status and an audit event atomically. It rejects stale versions and invalid regressions, and duplicate same-state observations do not add duplicate audit rows.
- Cancel/fill races can be represented if subsequent broker trade evidence confirms execution after a cancel. This code does not fetch that evidence itself.
- Latest verified test checkpoint: [run 39050941218](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39050941218), 261 passed, 1 warning. Broker reads, fill ingestion and live order placement/cancellation remain unimplemented.


### Phase 2 individual fill identity checkpoint — 17 October 2026
- Pure Upstox trade normalization and repository-only idempotent fill identity persistence are implemented and CI-tested. Identical duplicate trades are ignored; conflicting payloads are quarantined as conflicts. The repository does not fetch broker trades or update positions/P&L.
- Latest code/test run: [39052203329](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39052203329) — 274 passed, 1 warning, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks.
- Live trading remains unavailable and disabled.


### Phase 2 fill-to-intent validation checkpoint — 17 October 2026
Linked fill persistence now requires the same broker order ID and exact instrument, side, product and order type as the intent snapshot; it enforces order quantity ceilings and limit-price protection. [Run 39052939770](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39052939770) passed 279 tests, 1 warning, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks. It still does not fetch broker data or update live positions/P&L.


### Phase 2 unmatched-fill recovery foundation — 17 October 2026
A previously unmatched fill can now be linked to a local intent later, but only after broker order ID, account, instrument, side, product, order type, quantity and limit-price checks pass. The link and audit event are atomic; repeat linking is a no-op. [Run 39053352921](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39053352921) passed 281 tests, 1 warning. No broker polling or live accounting is implemented.


### Phase 2 out-of-order status/fill checkpoint — 17 October 2026
Order-state persistence now resolves broker status against already-persisted individual fill evidence before applying a transition. A stale OPEN/PENDING status cannot erase known partial fills; a partial fill followed by cancellation is represented separately; contradictory quantities/statuses are quarantined for review. Exact code checkpoint [run 39056392873](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39056392873) passed **294 tests, 1 warning**, including SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks. The read-only broker worker remains design-only; no live broker reads, order actions or accounting updates are implemented. See [READ_ONLY_RECONCILIATION_WORKER_DESIGN.md](READ_ONLY_RECONCILIATION_WORKER_DESIGN.md).


### Read-only Upstox reconciliation client — 17 October 2026
Added a separate fixed-path GET-only client for order book, details, history and per-order trades. It exposes no order-write methods and sanitizes upstream failures. Mocked contract tests passed in [run 39056868434](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39056868434): 309 passed, 1 warning, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks. The worker has not been implemented or invoked; no real broker requests or order actions occurred.


### Reconciliation lease foundation — 17 October 2026
Added a durable one-per-broker-connection lease with atomic claim, expiry/reclaim, renewal and stale-owner protection. Exact CI run [39057273255](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39057273255) passed 318 tests, 1 warning, including reversible SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migrations. The lease is not yet connected to a worker; no broker polling has started.


### Latest Phase 2 checkpoint — leased read-only reconciliation worker
`backend/app/services/live_order_reconciliation_worker.py` now provides an explicit on-demand, read-only reconciliation pass. It validates the user-owned Upstox connection and usable token, claims a per-connection lease, reads the order book and daily trades through the fixed GET-only client, uses bounded transient retries, matches local intents, and persists/deduplicates individual trade identities. It never places/modifies/cancels orders and never updates local portfolio accounting. The worker is not scheduled or wired to an API route; tests use mocks only. Latest CI [run 39058734080](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39058734080) passed **338 tests, 1 warning**, including SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks. Remaining: validate historical-day/session/pagination semantics, persist operator-facing summaries/manual-review cases, add crash-boundary tests, and only then consider a separately approved read-only sandbox check. Live submission remains disabled.


### Durable reconciliation run summaries
Every explicitly invoked read-only worker pass now creates a `live_reconciliation_runs` record after acquiring its lease. It stores timestamps, terminal status, a safe error category and count-only summary; raw broker responses, credentials and exception text are excluded. Migration `202610170004` and tests passed in [run 39059271937](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39059271937): 340 passed, 1 warning, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks. Stale `RUNNING` recovery and operator-facing manual-review records are not implemented yet.


### Durable manual-review queue foundation
The worker now persists deduplicated `live_reconciliation_issues` records for malformed broker rows, unmatched/ambiguous orders, trade conflicts, fill-link conflicts and status-transition conflicts. Issue details are allowlisted, credential-key-checked and limited to safe reason codes/normalized identifiers; repeat occurrences increment a counter and reopen the issue. Migration `202610170005` and tests passed in [run 39059749652](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39059749652): 342 passed, 1 warning. The queue currently exists only in the database—no UI/API resolution workflow yet. This newer checkpoint supersedes older dated README statements saying the worker did not exist.


### Read-only reconciliation review endpoints
Authenticated users can list their own safe run summaries at `GET /api/v1/reconciliation/runs` and manual-review issues at `GET /api/v1/reconciliation/issues`. Both routes are owner-scoped, support bounded filters and return sanitized schema fields only. Cross-user/auth tests passed in [run 39060230705](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39060230705): 345 passed, 1 warning, plus SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks. These endpoints do not trigger a worker or mutate issues/orders; frontend display and a separately reviewed resolution workflow are not implemented.


### Reconciliation review screen
The dashboard now links to `/reconciliation`, a read-only screen showing recent reconciliation run summaries and manual-review issues. It supports filtering by issue status and refreshing the list. It does not trigger broker reads or resolve issues. Frontend TypeScript/Next.js checks and backend CI passed for [commit e4343dcb](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/e4343dcb225c1f332b6c89399694d0a29a5df739): 345 backend tests passed, 1 warning; SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migrations passed. Issue resolution, stale-run recovery and historical trade windows remain unimplemented.


## Live-fill accounting recovery and verification — 2026-10-20

The deleted service, original tests and migration 0008 are restored to their original paths. Supporting models `BrokerOrder`, `BrokerTradeRecord`, `LivePosition` and migrations `202610180006` / `202610180007` were added to complete the chain. GitHub Actions [run 39475387511](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39475387511) passed **355 tests, 1 warning**, plus SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade → downgrade → re-upgrade checks at code/test checkpoint `a906274b98f3f7e0c913f376128f4996b996c52b`.

This is not a complete live-fill pipeline: the service remains unregistered, ingestion and reconciliation integration remain outstanding, and no real-account or production migration was performed. Keep live order submission disabled. Continue Phase 2 reconciliation release gates and crash/recovery/fill-linkage checks. Do not delete the recovered files without explicit user approval.


## Phase 3 live-fill accounting checkpoint — 2026-10-21

- Latest reviewed code HEAD at this checkpoint: `ef60ec93d39543c644dfd557f6f73b48ab793b60`.
- Exact-head [Backend CI run 39609474410](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39609474410) completed successfully: **485 passed, 1 warning in 30.25s**; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- The one warning is non-failing; CI logs also report GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation notices.
- Existing safeguards cover replay identity/charge validation, broker-confirmed fill quantities, cumulative child/order quantity limits, rejected-order protection, and atomic live-position/execution updates. This CI result verifies the current HEAD, not completion of all Phase 3 requirements.
- **Open Phase 3 requirement:** define and test the fee-allocation contract when a broker contract-note charge total covers multiple fills. The current API accepts a per-promotion breakdown and validates that its total equals its six components; it does not itself establish how a multi-fill contract-note total is allocated. Do not claim this issue resolved or wire in a coordinator/identity bridge until the rule is designed and regression-tested.
- Safety constraints unchanged: do not enable live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, or automatic scheduling; keep `BrokerFillIdentity` and `BrokerTradeRecord` separate pending a reviewed bridge design. Phase 2 remains closed.


## Phase 3 checkpoint refresh — 2026-10-21

- **Repository boundary:** all current Phase 3 work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, branch `main`. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is a protected baseline and must not be modified.
- **Current HEAD at audit start:** `3b5c8831d4f3475eee320176b3c06bdbd5364bd2` (source-ledger design-gate documentation). The documentation synchronization commit created after this note requires its own exact-HEAD CI result.
- **Latest confirmed backend CI during this audit:** [run 39618611385](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39618611385) completed successfully on **commit `49f95bdd5f20ee99b21a573087c6e97a9bc03526`**, with **485 passed, 1 warning in 30.65s**. The broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade steps passed. This run is an older SHA, not current HEAD; do not label later commits green based on it.
- **Phase 3 status:** in progress. Current blocker is verified actual-charge evidence and an approved allocation basis. Reviewed Upstox documented APIs provide trade data, aggregate charges, or estimates, but no verified per-fill actual-charge source/contract-note ingestion capability was found in the reviewed adapter/API catalogue. Do not treat estimates as actual charges or allocate aggregate totals by guess.
- **Next engineering sequence:** establish authoritative source format and retention/security boundary; then implement immutable source evidence and per-fill allocation records, migration, transactional reconciliation/idempotency, and required regression tests; finally verify exact-HEAD CI.
- **Safety:** live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. Phase 2 remains closed. This checkpoint is status tracking, not a claim that Phase 3 charge allocation is implemented.

## Phase 3 source-document access and integrity audit — 22 October 2026

- Audited the existing `BrokerChargeEvidence` model and `require_reviewed_charge_evidence` service on `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. The model persists filename, SHA-256, byte size, parser-version metadata, report reference, and review provenance, but explicitly stores the original document outside the table.
- No broker-contract-note-specific upload/retrieval endpoint or storage adapter was found in the audited application entrypoint, API route locations, service paths, and configuration. This is a scoped audit finding, not proof that no generic file handling exists elsewhere.
- The current evidence validator checks evidence identity/connection, source kind, reviewed status, reviewer identity/timestamp, and report reference. It does not retrieve the original bytes, recompute SHA-256/byte size, or parse an authoritative charge-component total.
- **Step 1 remains in progress; no source-storage implementation is claimed.** Before implementation, define a private, persistent, non-web-served storage boundary and a stable evidence-ID-to-object mapping. Retrieval must enforce authorization, prevent path traversal, verify the exact byte count and SHA-256 before parsing, and fail closed on missing/changed content. Do not treat a matching hash alone as proof of broker authenticity.
- Next implementation should add a configurable storage adapter and durable object key tied to the evidence record, then authenticated upload/retrieval and integrity tests. Choose the deployment-backed persistent volume only after confirming the Docker/VM volume layout; do not silently store source documents in an ephemeral container filesystem or Git.
- The prior successful PR-head CI run applies to its exact tested commit only; documentation updates require a fresh CI run on the resulting exact head. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

## Phase 3 private contract-note storage implementation — 22 October 2026

- Added configurable `BROKER_CHARGE_DOCUMENT_ROOT` (default `/var/lib/tradepro/contract-notes`) and a named Docker volume mounted only into backend and worker containers, not Nginx/frontend.
- Added authenticated upload/download endpoints under `/api/v1/broker-charge-evidence`. Upload requires ownership of the broker connection, limits files to 10 MiB, uses an application-generated UUID key, records SHA-256, byte size, and uploader identity (`received_by_user_id`), and leaves evidence in `RECEIVED`; it never auto-reviews or promotes accounting.
- Added atomic private file storage and integrity-checked retrieval. Opaque keys reject path traversal; missing/modified content fails closed. Added storage-service tests for round-trip, tampering, missing documents, invalid keys, empty input, and deletion, plus API tests for owner-scoped upload/download and tamper rejection.
- Alembic revision `202610220011` adds nullable `storage_key` for legacy evidence compatibility. **Exact-head CI and SQLite/PostgreSQL migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks remain required.**
- SHA-256 proves byte continuity with the recorded upload, not broker-origin authenticity. Independent source-component parsing/review, persisted component provenance, exact fill-set/amount/currency/rounding reconciliation, and atomic promotion remain later Phase 3 gates.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. Work remains exclusively in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 durable source-component provenance — 22 October 2026

- Added `BrokerChargeSourceComponent` and Alembic revision `202610220012` to persist a charge component's evidence ID, exact source SHA-256, component name, INR amount, source page/row locator, extraction method, parser-version field, extracting user, status, reviewer, review timestamp, and review note.
- This first workflow is explicitly **manual transcription**, versioned as `manual-transcription-v1`; it does not claim that a broker-specific parser exists or that the amount was machine-extracted. No PDF/CSV parser or broker document format was assumed.
- Added authenticated endpoints to record a component as `PENDING_REVIEW`, verify the original file's stored fingerprint/size before recording or reviewing, and require a distinct platform administrator (the existing `is_admin` role) to confirm the amount against the original source before it becomes `VERIFIED`. Rejected components remain rejected; duplicate component entries and non-INR currencies fail closed.
- Added API regression tests for pending-before-review behavior, same-user review rejection, distinct-reviewer verification, tampered-source rejection, invalid currency, and duplicate component prevention.
- CI run [39742979087](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39742979087) passed on code head `c1004fb5718592fb76ccf50c4007a0d8aec11fb7`: 542 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed. **This documentation synchronization creates a newer head, so recheck exact-head CI before merge.** This is source-component provenance, not the final reconciliation gate: allocation totals must still match verified source components, exact eligible fill sets, currency, and rounding policy under a transaction before any future promotion is considered.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. All changes target `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, never original `Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 allocation-ledger verification — 22 October 2026

- Added `verify_component_allocation_ledger` as a fail-closed verifier for a reviewed source component and its allocation rows. It rechecks the stored document fingerprint/size and validates component/evidence review provenance.
- Source-component review persists the canonical sorted eligible trade-record UUID set, its SHA-256 manifest fingerprint, the approved `largest-remainder-v1` method, and the reviewer-approved allocation basis. The reviewer must identify persisted fills from the same broker connection; duplicate/missing/cross-connection IDs are rejected.
- Verification requires the allocation ledger's exact fill set to equal the reviewed manifest, every source total to equal the independently reviewed component amount, currency/method/basis to match, and the paise-exact allocated sum to equal the source amount. Evidence, component, allocation rows, and fills are locked during verification.
- Transactional promotion is implemented in `promote_verified_component_allocations` in `broker_charge_allocation_reconciliation_service.py`. It calls the verifier while holding the transaction locks, requires the authorized source-component reviewer, promotes the entire eligible set to `RECONCILED` with a deterministic durable reference, and supports exact idempotent replay. It uses a savepoint and does not commit the caller's outer transaction; callers must commit only with the enclosing accounting operation. It is service-only, not exposed as a public API endpoint.
- Mismatched source bytes, provenance, fill set, amount, currency, method, basis, mixed/rejected statuses, or stale references fail closed; the full set remains pending or the transaction rolls back. No partial promotion is allowed.
- Tests cover exact verification, fill-set/source-total/tampered-source failures, successful atomic promotion, idempotent replay, wrong-reviewer rejection, and outer-transaction rollback. CI run [39745393196](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39745393196) passed on code head `007c41796da7413823a98f92360d93af074ab88e`: **549 tests passed, 1 warning**; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- CI run [39745820117](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39745820117) passed on exact head `5139146d48cb3f5906db77014a93b5d20ead3146`: 549 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips passed. This is a historical exact-head checkpoint; every later code or documentation commit must receive its own exact-head CI verification before merge. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled.

## Phase 3 transactional allocation promotion — 22 October 2026

- Added `promote_verified_component_allocations` as an internal service (not an API endpoint). It re-runs the source-document, review-provenance, exact fill-set, amount, INR currency, rounding-method, approved-basis, and total checks while locking the relevant evidence, component, allocation, and trade rows.
- Promotion sets the complete eligible allocation set to `RECONCILED` and writes a deterministic durable reference tying the component UUID, source SHA-256, and eligible-fill-set SHA-256. It rejects mixed, rejected, stale-reference, incomplete, or mismatched sets.
- The operation runs inside a savepoint and **never commits the caller's transaction**. The caller must commit only after the whole enclosing transaction succeeds. A repeated exact promotion is idempotent; tests cover successful promotion, replay, unauthorized actor rejection, and outer-transaction rollback.
- This internal service is not wired to an automatic accounting path or exposed as an API endpoint. Live broker submission remains disabled; the service does not itself create accounting entries or send orders.
- CI run [39745393196](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39745393196) passed on promotion-code head `007c41796da7413823a98f92360d93af074ab88e`: 549 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips passed. Step 4 code is verified at that head; any subsequent code or documentation commits require another exact-head CI check before merge. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and all changes remain exclusively in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.

## Phase 3 final audit follow-up — 22 October 2026

- Preserved rejected source-component history: each evidence/component pair now uses a positive revision number; a new transcription is allowed only after prior revisions for that component are rejected. Pending or verified duplicates remain blocked, and the unique evidence/component/revision constraint protects concurrent attempts.
- Promotion now rechecks that the recorded reviewer is still an active platform administrator at promotion time, in addition to matching the reviewed component identity. Loss of authorization fails closed and leaves allocations pending.
- Exact-head CI run [39746382703](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39746382703) passed on `6870fdc8a0bee91f486a250351eac1beb7edbf3d`: 551 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed. Any later commit requires a fresh exact-head CI check before merge.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled, and allocation promotion is still an internal transaction-owned service rather than a public API endpoint.


## Phase 3 exact-head verification checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Current reviewed PR head at checkpoint start: `2d524632a98167e360be249a5bf255a55cae6daf` on `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation` in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39746755812](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39746755812) completed successfully: 551 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip checks passed. This supersedes earlier notes in this document that described this commit's CI as pending.
- The PostgreSQL concurrency test exists at `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`; it requires CI's dedicated `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`. The previous documented successful PostgreSQL race run is still a separate earlier commit; confirm the current run's test job environment/logs before claiming this exact run exercised the race test.
- Document storage writes atomically to a private file and verifies SHA-256 and byte count on retrieval. Deployment backup/restore and cleanup of orphaned files remain operational follow-ups; code-level storage tests do not prove production recovery procedures.
- Outstanding review gates: confirm the current CI run executed the PostgreSQL race test; review transaction/authorization behavior and accounting integration; verify deployment volume backup/restore; assess broker-source authenticity limitations. SHA-256 proves byte continuity against recorded evidence, not broker-origin authenticity.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending review and explicit approval. No live broker order submission or automatic accounting posting is enabled. Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.


## Follow-up: upload rollback cleanup and residual orphan risk — 22 October 2026

- Re-reviewed `backend/app/api/v1/broker_charge_evidence.py` at PR #6 branch `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. After writing the private document, the upload endpoint commits the evidence row; on `IntegrityError` or other caught exceptions it rolls back the database session and attempts `delete_document` for the generated storage key. This is an existing compensating cleanup path and should not be described as entirely absent.
- Residual risk remains: process termination between successful file write and database commit, or failure during the compensating delete, can leave an unreferenced object. Current tests prove basic storage/read integrity but do not demonstrate crash injection or production orphan reconciliation.
- Safe next improvement: add a read-only audit command/service that enumerates only validated 32-hex storage keys and compares them with database `storage_key` values; report missing referenced files, mismatched hashes/sizes, and unreferenced files without deleting anything. Cleanup should be a separate explicit, audited operation with age/grace-period checks and approval; never delete automatically during audit.
- Operational validation still required: coordinated backup and isolated restore of both PostgreSQL `postgres_data` and `broker_charge_documents`, then verify each restored evidence object's storage key, SHA-256, and byte size. Compose mounts confirm shared runtime volume wiring, not a backup guarantee.
- Last verified CI before this documentation follow-up: run [39747922164](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39747922164) passed for commit `f87dd096b2e2f4044b1eb67fa63e277bceb136c9`; rerun and verify CI after the final documentation commit before treating this checkpoint as closed.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending final review and explicit approval. SHA-256 verifies byte continuity against recorded metadata, not broker-origin authenticity. No automatic accounting posting or live broker order submission is enabled. Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.


## Read-only contract-note storage audit checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Implemented `audit_contract_note_storage` in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_document_storage_service.py`. It compares evidence rows to files in the configured storage root and reports missing files, size/SHA-256 mismatches, invalid storage keys, duplicate database keys, and unreferenced opaque-key files. The audit is read-only and never deletes files.
- Added regression tests for a clean store and for missing, tampered, and unreferenced files. Exact-head CI run [39749195128](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39749195128) passed on commit `e7214e970b8e2fa3e966dc339141288a30154038`: **553 passed, 1 warning**; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- The endpoint-level database-rollback plus cleanup-failure path is covered by a regression test. Still required: interrupted-process/crash recovery validation, an isolated coordinated PostgreSQL-plus-document-volume restore drill, and final accounting/idempotency review.
- Do not automatically delete orphaned files. Cleanup remains a separate approved, audited operation with grace-period safeguards. SHA-256 demonstrates byte continuity against recorded evidence, not broker-origin authenticity.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending final review and explicit approval. Live broker order submission remains disabled. Scope is `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.


## Upload cleanup regression checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added a regression test for the contract-note cleanup helper when storage deletion raises `OSError`; the failure is logged and does not escape the helper, allowing the upload handler to preserve its original database exception.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39750696319](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39750696319) passed on commit `279ea3e6f170dc991c243b57372b86e86db065ee`: **554 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passed.
- Upload-recovery coverage is now stronger: an endpoint-level regression test forces database commit failure plus compensating file-deletion failure, then verifies the orphan is reported by the read-only storage audit. This is a simulated integration test, not a production restore drill.
- Remaining gates: coordinated PostgreSQL + contract-note-volume restore drill; independently reviewed source-origin evidence; final allocation replay/idempotency and promotion transaction review; CI verification after the next documentation or code change.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled. Scope is `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.


### Phase 3 checkpoint — 2026-10-22 (contract-note upload recovery integration)

- Added a real upload-endpoint regression test that forces the evidence database commit to fail after the source bytes are written, then forces compensating file deletion to fail. The test verifies the original database exception remains visible, no evidence row persists, and the read-only storage audit identifies the unreferenced opaque-key file without deleting it.
- CI run 39752136518 passed on test commit 5cfa76e14add51a34e6bc157ad328c74d9f2a33b: 555 passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration checks completed successfully.
- This validates the simulated endpoint/database/storage failure path; it is not a production-volume backup/restore drill and does not establish contract-note authenticity beyond recorded SHA-256/size continuity.
- Remaining gates: coordinated database plus document-volume backup/restore drill; final source-evidence, exact fill-set, currency/rounding, idempotency, and atomic-promotion review; synchronize this checkpoint across all nine documents and rerun CI on the final documentation commit.
- Scope/safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled.


### Phase 3 restore-drill gate

- Do not mark backup/restore complete based on Compose volume declarations or unit tests. In an isolated environment, take a consistent PostgreSQL backup and a matching snapshot/archive of the `broker_charge_documents` volume, restore both into an isolated stack, run the storage audit, verify representative evidence hashes/sizes and database-to-file references, then record the backup identifiers, timestamps, commands, results, and any missing/mismatched/unreferenced files. No production restore has been performed by this checkpoint.


### CI verification checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- Documentation commit `13a406891b286dd8077ee1430c1d62f3b6086309` passed GitHub Actions run `39753249388` for the backend pytest workflow. That run alone establishes the backend test result; do not attribute broker-write guard or SQLite/PostgreSQL migration checks to it without separate exact-commit job evidence.
- This CI result applies to that exact commit only. These documentation updates will create a new head and require a fresh CI result before being called verified.
- Production backup/restore remains unperformed. The required isolated drill must restore PostgreSQL and `broker_charge_documents` together, then validate source hashes/sizes and database/file references; do not infer restore success from CI or volume declarations.


### Exact-head CI scope correction — 2026-10-22

- Latest verified head before this note, `bb46a17dd8578ccce1858ed820584a4348c05e8f`, passed GitHub Actions run `39753596786`: **555 passed, 1 warning in 39.40s** in the Backend pytest job.
- The run queried for that SHA exposes only the Backend pytest job. Therefore this exact-head result does not independently establish the broker-write guard or SQLite/PostgreSQL migration round-trip checks; cite earlier runs for those only at their own SHAs.
- This note creates a new documentation head; verify CI on the resulting exact head before considering it fully checkpointed. The coordinated database + document-volume restore drill remains unperformed.


### Phase 3 backup/restore runbook checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- Added `docs/PHASE3_BACKUP_RESTORE_DRILL.md`, a step-by-step isolated procedure for paired PostgreSQL + `broker_charge_documents` backup, restore into a separate target, SHA-256 artifact verification, storage-audit acceptance, and recorded reviewer sign-off.
- The runbook is a procedure only. No actual coordinated backup/restore has been performed or claimed by this commit. Keep the worker stopped in the target until integrity checks pass; never restore over production or enable live broker orders for this drill.
- Latest prior documentation commit `8b3c87da67aea8d21cca8a6748b7d27b88a1878a` passed backend pytest in run `39754157399`. This new runbook and documentation checkpoint creates a new head and requires fresh CI verification.


### Phase 3 exact-head CI and acceptance checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- GitHub Actions run 39754635028 passed on PR head 17e9f9d220e504c2a522d8c98289c2765bf02dd2: backend pytest reported 555 passed, 1 warning in 39.64s; the broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip checks passed in this run's job logs. Verify the exact run if this branch advances.
- Accounting acceptance remains under review: code-level checks cover exact fill-set matching, deterministic paise-level largest-remainder allocation, conflict/replay rejection, PostgreSQL evidence-row serialization, and transactional promotion. This is not proof that real contract-note source amounts or production restore have been independently validated.
- The isolated coordinated PostgreSQL + broker_charge_documents restore drill has NOT been executed. Do not claim restore success. Restore into a separate target, verify artifact checksums, file sizes and SHA-256 fingerprints, database/file references and read-only storage audit, retain logs and reviewer sign-off, and keep workers/live broker writes disabled throughout.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged. All work is limited to tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; the original Tradepro repository is out of scope. Live broker order submission remains disabled.
- This documentation checkpoint creates a new commit/head and therefore requires CI verification on the resulting exact head before the checkpoint is considered fully verified.


### Exact-head CI completion — 2026-10-22

- GitHub Actions run 39755207327 completed successfully on commit 5744e8433a5a486938f6e2d6bed5b705ecaea869. Backend pytest passed; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks all passed. See https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39755207327.
- This confirms that commit only. The following documentation checkpoint will create a new head and must itself receive fresh CI verification.
- Coordinated isolated restore drill remains unexecuted; do not claim recovery acceptance. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker submission remains disabled; original Tradepro remains out of scope.


### GitHub-only environment clarification and latest CI result — 2026-10-22

- User confirmed Tradepro Improved exists on GitHub only; do not assume a user-local Docker checkout/host. All project work remains restricted to tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; original Tradepro is out of scope.
- GitHub Actions run 39755480864 passed on commit 1d1533d70eca904e9650a813c671927475cacd36. Backend test suite, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration round-trip, and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip all succeeded. Run: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39755480864.
- Restore drill is still NOT executed. Since no user-local environment should be assumed, the next recovery step must be provisioned as a disposable isolated CI/cloud environment or explicitly established as unavailable. Do not claim restore success absent captured execution evidence, checksums, storage audit, counts, and reviewer sign-off.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled. Any new commit requires its own exact-head CI verification.


### Synthetic restore CI coverage — 2026-10-22

- Added a GitHub Actions step to create a synthetic PostgreSQL evidence table and a synthetic opaque-key document, capture a PostgreSQL custom-format dump plus document archive, verify backup checksums, restore both into a separate temporary database/directory, and compare the restored file SHA-256/byte size and database metadata.
- The workflow retains the synthetic evidence bundle as artifact `synthetic-restore-drill-evidence` for 14 days, including checksum manifest, synthetic dump/archive, result record and expected/restored metadata. This is synthetic CI evidence only, not recovery evidence for real contract-note backups or production data.
- New workflow commits require exact-head CI to finish green before considering this automation validated. The actual coordinated restore drill using real retained backup artifacts remains outstanding; do not claim full recovery acceptance.
- Project is GitHub-only; do not assume a local Docker host. All work remains limited to tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; original Tradepro is out of scope. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and live broker order submission remains disabled.


### Latest synthetic restore workflow acceptance checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- GitHub Actions run 39756592781 completed with conclusion success on exact head 98b8260adf17fbee2d6cfe51fcd86175584334c4. Backend tests, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document archive restore, and evidence-retention step all passed. Run: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39756592781.
- GitHub retained artifact `synthetic-restore-drill-evidence` (artifact ID 12415978081, size 2208 bytes, SHA-256 digest `e2d18437b94a16b1b649ee94deaf81428d35406ab54a731bfef1750c7f360fe2`, expiry 2026-11-05). This confirms synthetic test evidence only; it is not proof of restoring actual retained contract-note backups. Artifact run: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39756592781.
- Accounting acceptance remains open pending independent verification of original contract-note source/component amounts, exact fill identities, paise-level totals, replay/conflict behavior and enclosing-transaction rollback/atomic promotion. The code review alone does not close those gates.
- No local Docker host is assumed; user confirmed Tradepro Improved is GitHub-only. A restore against real retained backup artifacts remains outstanding. All work stays in tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; original Tradepro is out of scope. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and live broker order submission remains disabled.
- This checkpoint changes documentation and must receive fresh CI on the resulting exact head before it can be called CI-verified.

### Phase 3 source-to-ledger review follow-up — 2026-10-22

- Exact-head GitHub Actions run `39757964236` passed on commit `0c74960c9b0bb1590aa14ef709f55e691b3ac5e2`, covering backend pytest, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document restore, and evidence artifact retention.
- Code review confirms evidence-row serialization, broker-connection validation for target fills, conflicting replay rejection, and pending status until source-ledger verification/promotion.
- Source component values remain human-transcribed; CI fixtures are synthetic and cannot verify real contract-note amounts or real backup recovery. Both real-evidence acceptance gates remain open.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker writes remain disabled; original `Tradepro` is out of scope. Do not treat this note as approval to merge or enable live trading.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — lock-order regression verified (22 October 2026)

- Latest exact-head CI run [39817017949](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39817017949) passed on commit `7809e8d7981a19625142dc73e689caa2976c97d6`: backend pytest **565 passed, 1 warning**.
- Live-fill accounting now defers target allocation-row locks until after source-component verification, refreshes target allocations under lock, and fails closed if their state changed. The regression test checks lock-order invariants rather than a brittle exact query prefix.
- A preceding implementation run failed on an outdated test expectation; the test was corrected and the latest run passed.
- PostgreSQL concurrency coverage exists for competing allocation requests on one evidence record. Concurrent source verification versus promotion, deadlock/retry handling, and conflicting fill-set replay still need further review.
- Real contract-note authenticity and a real retained Oracle Cloud database/document restore remain deferred until real evidence is available. Synthetic restore testing does not prove real-data recovery.
- PR #6 remains open/draft/unmerged pending review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled.
- Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.


## Exact-head CI checkpoint — 2026-10-23

- Verified PR #6 head `f75471c5bc64bc9ede61c7dc621d1200e97fa078` with GitHub Actions run [39927004048](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39927004048): Backend pytest job completed successfully; broker-write boundary guard, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence-retention step all passed.
- This result applies to that exact PR head. Any documentation commit creates a new head and must receive its own CI verification before the checkpoint is considered current.
- Synthetic restore evidence is not proof of restoring the user's real Oracle Cloud database/document backup. Actual retained-backup restore and authenticated real broker-source validation remain separate acceptance items.
- The integrated concurrency test that races real `LiveFillAccountingService.promote_trade` with allocation-ledger verification/promotion remains an open Phase 3 acceptance gate; do not treat the accounting review as complete yet.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance-gate review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. All changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## Follow-up verification — 23 October 2026 (supersedes stale pending wording)

- Exact current head `3c592de0bb2262ec4753196dfba26d7a31c70986` passed GitHub Actions Backend tests in [run 39927573489](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39927573489). The job passed pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, and restore-evidence retention.
- Code inspection confirms `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py::test_live_fill_promotion_races_with_component_ledger_verification` exists. It races `LiveFillAccountingService.promote_trade` against `verify_component_allocation_ledger` using synthetic persisted evidence and asserts no errors, one inserted execution, one live position, and reconciled component allocations. The CI job passed this PostgreSQL-enabled integration suite.
- Therefore, earlier checkpoint text describing this exact integrated race test as still absent is superseded. Remaining Phase 3 acceptance is broader review of charge-component allocation policy and evidence provenance, source authenticity limits for public examples, plus separate real Oracle backup/restore validation; synthetic tests do not prove real-account authenticity or actual backup recovery.
- PR #6 remains draft/open/unmerged until all acceptance gates are reviewed and the user explicitly approves. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Scope remains only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains outside scope.


## Component-specific allocation policy review — 23 October 2026

- Added `PHASE3_COMPONENT_ALLOCATION_POLICY.md` documenting the key distinction between deterministic allocation arithmetic and a justified charge-specific attribution basis.
- Public references reviewed: [Upstox brokerage/charges](https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/), [Upstox brokerage calculator](https://upstox.com/calculator/brokerage-calculator/), [NSE levies/STT](https://www.nseindia.com/static/invest/first-time-investor-sebi-turnover-fees-stt-other-levies), and [NSE stamp duty](https://www.nseindia.com/static/invest/first-time-investor-stamp-duty-charges-taxes). Public tariff pages show effective-date and segment/product differences; rates must not be hardcoded as timeless or inferred from historical sample notes.
- Policy gap: the generic allocator's support for QUANTITY, NOTIONAL and EXPLICIT_REVIEWED is not blanket approval for those bases for every component. Brokerage/order caps, GST tax-base composition, buy-side-only stamp duty, side/product-specific STT and exchange charges, and account/scrip-level fees need component-appropriate rules and tests. The new policy file records the acceptance matrix and tests still required.
- Exact head before this policy-doc addition, `6d922d3436dcf2b3def7b5c77665056be173fab1`, passed Backend tests in [run 39928182307](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39928182307), including pytest, broker-write guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore/evidence retention. The new policy documentation commit and subsequent doc-sync commit(s) require their own exact-head CI before being marked verified.
- PR #6 remains draft/open/unmerged pending policy gates, full acceptance review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` is out of scope.


## Fail-closed allocation gate — CI verified 23 October 2026

- Commit `2e14ce6feed8357a85813ec5924e577879b2e4ca` passed GitHub Actions [run 39929331878](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39929331878). Backend pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, evidence retention, and cleanup all completed successfully.
- The source-reconciliation verification gate now rejects `QUANTITY` and `NOTIONAL` allocation bases until component-specific effective-dated rules are approved. A regression test verifies unsupported notional allocation raises and rows remain `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`. Explicitly reviewed per-fill weights remain available, subject to existing provenance/reviewer/promotion checks.
- This is a conservative fail-closed safeguard, not completion of component-specific tariff automation. Still required: reviewed tests/rules for brokerage caps and multi-fill orders, GST taxable base, buy-side stamp duty, side/product-specific STT/CTT, exchange/segment charges and effective-date transitions. Ambiguous source scope must remain pending.
- Publicly shared Upstox contract-note examples are for layout/research only and are not independently authenticated. Actual Oracle Cloud backup recovery remains separate from synthetic restore CI.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged until acceptance gates are reviewed and the user explicitly approves. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Changes are confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


### Phase 3 tariff-estimate audit safeguards

Tariff estimates are persisted as `ESTIMATE_ONLY` snapshots and are not broker-confirmed actual charges. The Phase 3 branch now adds database triggers on PostgreSQL and SQLite to reject direct SQL updates/deletes of these snapshots. The latest exact-head CI run passed. Conditional/order-level tariff caps and estimate-versus-actual variance integration remain in progress; do not rely on simplified rates as production-approved charges. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged, and live broker order writes remain disabled.


### Tariff-estimate audit controls

Tariff snapshots are estimate-only and append-only. PostgreSQL and SQLite triggers block direct SQL updates/deletes, and PostgreSQL race tests cover exact replay versus conflicting payloads. The code checkpoint passed 677 tests and migration/restore checks in [CI run 39960409771](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39960409771). Conditional/order-level tariff caps and estimate-versus-actual variance integration remain incomplete; estimates must never be treated as actual charges. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and live broker order writes remain disabled.


### Estimate-versus-actual variance

Tradepro Improved now stores variance-only comparisons separately from actual charge allocation. The comparison requires reviewed contract-note evidence and an exact single-fill scope; it records estimate, actual, difference and percentage without modifying allocation rows. Aggregate/multi-fill variance and advanced tariff caps/special charge bases remain unsupported. The code checkpoint passed 680 tests and safety/migration/restore checks in [CI run 39961777103](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39961777103). PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order writes disabled.


### Verified exact PR-head CI 39962196672
Current draft PR #6 head `c47bc3e3eeb4c8da4415132735d2d4ef457551f7` passed [CI](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39962196672): 680 passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard passed, no failed steps. Phase 3 remains open for aggregate variance, advanced tariff semantics, and final accounting review. PR remains draft/unmerged and live broker order writes disabled.


### Aggregate tariff variance status
The Phase 3 design now documents a proposed exact-fill-set model for order-level estimate-versus-actual comparisons. This is a design proposal, not a supported feature. Aggregate comparisons remain unavailable until implemented, reviewed and tested. Per-fill accounting and live-order safeguards remain unchanged.


### Variance validation update
Variance comparison now verifies the reviewed fill-manifest digest and checks that the linked broker fill's side and trade date match the estimate. Regression tests were added. The latest code head still requires CI verification; aggregate variance and advanced tariff semantics remain unsupported.


### Latest verified code CI
CI run [39968000009](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39968000009) passed for code head `f5092df1d27a28006dccba929fdc41e9a1d63f1e`: 683 passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard passed; SQLite migration and isolated PostgreSQL 16 synthetic restore checks passed. This run predates the latest documentation-only updates. Aggregate variance and advanced tariff semantics remain open.


### Aggregate variance status
The first implementation pass adds explicit single-fill/order-fill-set estimate scope and exact fill-manifest validation for reviewed actual comparisons. Aggregate variance is still pending exact-head CI and migration verification; it is not yet accepted for production use. Advanced tariff models remain separately gated.


## 2026-10-24 — Resolver acceptance and CI checkpoint

- Backend workflow `40108183667` succeeded on prior head `8214430f562f6f425cfc1b9b6a3b547832b68a`. New resolver tests add exact broker/endpoint/schema/field/scope matching and non-finite-number rejection; newer commits still require CI.
- Mapping identity fixtures use immutable dataclass replacement. Intended-use semantics remain explicit; missing/null/invalid values remain unusable and retain provenance; numeric zero remains distinct.
- Accounting acceptance includes replay/conflict, ledger reconciliation, lock order, rollback, reviewer authority and PostgreSQL verification/promotion race coverage. Re-check exact test and workflow status before claiming complete. CI does not establish production tariff correctness or broker-origin authenticity.
- Safety gates unchanged: PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs unapproved. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Resolver field-identity guard added; CI pending

- Resolver now checks that the payload field name matches the terminal field in the selected approved mapping path. This closes a semantic mismatch where a caller could select `charges.ipft` but normalize another payload field.
- Implementation commit: `77aa77aec37dc535c3e427ca3f88c2ccb5e75ed8`; regression test commit: `5c5482c7f7fa623707698f64b6a061351e5e5b87`. CI for latest commits is pending; previous green runs apply only to earlier heads.
- Existing accounting tests cover lock ordering, replay idempotency, conflicting evidence and rollback. A genuine concurrent two-session verification-versus-promotion race is not demonstrated in the inspected live-fill test file; verify other integration coverage before marking complete.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs remain unapproved. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Latest resolver CI and PostgreSQL concurrency suite verified

- Latest implementation/documentation checkpoint `ed346e823cbfae8448fae0134c4ff864bfcc60ac` passed Backend pytest workflow [#40109041654](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40109041654): **872 passed, 1 warning**, with the broker-write boundary guard also passing.
- Dedicated PostgreSQL concurrency tests are present in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`, including source verification vs allocation promotion and live-fill promotion vs ledger verification. The successful CI summary reports no skipped tests, so this run exercised the collected suite; the race tests are part of that test set.
- This confirms test execution and safeguards in the synthetic PostgreSQL test environment; it does not establish production broker tariff correctness or approve any real Upstox field mapping.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Work only in `tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Official tariff/API source audit

- Upstox's `GET /v2/trade/profit-loss/charges` is a segment/financial-year/date-range aggregate `charges_breakdown`, not a documented per-fill record; its example returns `charges.ipft: null`. Do not map this response directly to actual per-fill evidence. Null is not zero. https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-charges/
- NSE circular NSE/FA/73061 (27-Feb-2026, effective 1-Mar-2026) sets combined member outflow at ₹307/crore cash, ₹183/crore equity futures, ₹3,553/crore equity-option premium, including ₹0.01/crore IPFT contribution each side. This does not approve a broker-specific payload mapping. https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf
- Upstox's charges page contains both historical and newer effective-date tables; use effective-dated rules and account for its published STT/CTT transition from 1-Apr-2026. Avoid stale rates and double-counting separately stated IPFT where the exchange rate is combined. https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/
- Production mappings/tariffs remain unapproved. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Work only in `tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.
- The implementation head `ee1b2a74d2a9f6141b9afbb6e06562b5cf263a9b` passed workflow #40110597753; the present documentation commits need their own CI verification.


## 2026-10-24 — Upstox brokerage calculator restricted to estimates; CI pending

- Official Upstox `GET /v2/charges/brokerage` calculates charges from proposed order inputs; it is not proof of final booked per-fill charges. https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/
- Resolver blocks this endpoint from `PER_FILL_ACTUAL` and actual `AGGREGATE_SUMMARY` use, even if a mapping is misleadingly labelled. `/v2/trade/profit-loss/charges` remains aggregate-only for per-fill purposes. Regression tests cover both mislabelled cases.
- Implementation `3486d854dae2451858a858cb627602aca7338969`; tests `6c92101a1890a0f4d761e86ed3db047a269fd10d`. The prior head passed workflow #40111501429; latest implementation/test CI must be verified.
- Production mappings/tariffs unapproved; null is not zero; automatic quantity/notional allocation and live order submission disabled. PR #6 draft/unmerged. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` untouched.

## Upstox SDK/API integration status — 2026-10-24

The Upstox integration has an audit and explicit adoption gate: [Upstox SDK/API Repository Audit](docs/UPSTOX_SDK_API_REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md). Existing async REST clients, V3 WebSocket/protobuf streaming, read-only reconciliation, and validated brokerage-charge response parsing were found. The official Python SDK is not currently declared as a backend dependency; adoption is pending a version-pinned compatibility spike and is not assumed merely because the SDK is available. The brokerage calculator is an estimate, not realized per-fill accounting evidence. Keep PAPER mode mandatory and live broker order writes disabled.

### Agent Skill security review

Before using the official Upstox Agent Skill, read [`docs/UPSTOX_AGENT_SKILL_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`](docs/UPSTOX_AGENT_SKILL_SECURITY_REVIEW.md). The skill includes live order/GTT examples and is development-only reference material, not a production dependency. No runtime SDK dependency was added by the static audit because the current async REST client and response parser already cover the reviewed brokerage-estimate endpoint.



## Versioned exchange-charge representation contract — 25 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_representation_contract.py` with pinned contract version `exchange-charge-representation-v1`. The validator requires an explicit reviewed representation mode, preserves original source labels, validates normalized component names and paise-precision amounts, and rejects combined transaction charges plus a separate IPFT amount to prevent double counting.
- Added `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_representation_contract.py` covering combined versus split representations, equivalent ₹307.00 exchange-charge base, duplicate IPFT rejection, missing components, unknown/inferred modes, invalid amounts, raw-label retention, and unsupported component labels.
- This contract validates representation only. It deliberately returns `accounting_approved: false`; it does not authenticate a source document, approve a broker API mapping, decide GST taxable composition, allocate aggregate amounts to fills, or enable live accounting. Existing promotion remains fail-closed.
- The implementation and test commits are `3c9ac46ea58257ba4c9c87b1b664eee14c6bd35a` and `be505e3dbc0e93eaa25a012d6a9afba81712e9ab`. Exact-head CI for the latest docs/code head must be checked before this checkpoint is called verified.
- PR #6 remains draft/open/unmerged; PAPER mode remains mandatory; live broker order writes and automatic generic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Persisted transaction/IPFT representation gate — 25 October 2026

- Added migration `202610250020` and nullable `source_label` / `representation_mode` fields on `broker_charge_source_components`. Existing rows retain their normalized component name as a source-label fallback, but representation mode is deliberately left undeclared rather than inferred.
- Source-component intake now preserves the original label and optional explicit mode. Review of `transaction_charges` / `ipft` rows invokes the versioned representation validator and remains blocked when mode is missing, when combined mode also has a separate IPFT row, when split mode lacks either row, or when sibling rows disagree on mode. Rejected review attempts leave rows pending.
- Added API regression tests for persisted label/mode, combined-plus-separate-IPFT rejection, and missing-mode rejection. Exact-head CI is required before calling this checkpoint verified.
- This is still not production tariff approval: GST composition, endpoint/schema semantics, authenticated real contract-note evidence, and per-fill allocation approval remain separate gates. No live broker writes or generic quantity/notional allocation were enabled.


## Representation-gate CI correction — 25 October 2026

- The first API regression run exposed two assertion-message mismatches: the validator correctly rejected ambiguous combined-plus-IPFT input and undeclared representation mode, but the tests expected different wording. Updated the tests to assert the validator's actual fail-closed error messages; no safety rule was weakened.
- Follow-up exact-head CI for commit `df344e9c64aeb6ec3f2f01fef01f3c05739d4800` and subsequent documentation synchronization is pending. Do not call the current head green until the full workflow completes.


## Source-label completeness gate — 25 October 2026

- The source representation contract now requires one retained original source label for every normalized charge component. Incomplete label intake is rejected before review; this does not approve any API field mapping or production accounting rule.
- Regression coverage includes a split transaction/IPFT payload missing a source label. Exact-head CI for the synchronized documentation head remains a required verification gate.
- Tariff candidates remain DRAFT; GST component composition and Upstox API/contract-note field semantics remain open. No generic quantity/notional allocation or live broker order writes were enabled.
- Safety: work only in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mode mandatory; original `Tradepro` untouched.


## Authoritative IPFT/GST decision — 25 October 2026

This is the carried-forward project decision. Do not restart the IPFT/GST policy discussion or describe the agreed arithmetic as undecided. Keep the policy decision separate from the remaining source-evidence and production-approval gates.

### IPFT and NSE exchange-charge representation

Effective 1 March 2026, NSE circular NSE/FA/73061 records combined exchange-charge rates that include the IPFT contribution:
- Cash equity: ₹307.00 per crore.
- Equity futures: ₹183.00 per crore.
- Equity options: ₹3,553.00 per crore.

Canonical equivalent split arithmetic (transaction charges excluding IPFT, plus IPFT exactly once):
- Cash equity: ₹306.99 + ₹0.01 = ₹307.00 per crore.
- Equity futures: ₹182.99 + ₹0.01 = ₹183.00 per crore.
- Equity options: ₹3,552.99 + ₹0.01 = ₹3,553.00 per crore.

Rules:
1. For an explicitly reviewed combined source, preserve and use the combined transaction-charge amount; do not add a separate IPFT amount.
2. For an explicitly reviewed split source, use the transaction-charge amount excluding IPFT and add the separately evidenced IPFT amount once.
3. Never infer combined/split semantics from a field name alone. Preserve the original source label, endpoint/schema/version and raw value.
4. If the representation is missing, conflicting, null where an actual amount is required, or otherwise ambiguous, fail closed; do not silently substitute zero or promote it to actual per-fill accounting.
5. The combined/split validator is a representation safeguard, not proof of authentic source data or approval of a production API mapping.

Primary reference: NSE circular NSE/FA/73061, dated 27 February 2026, effective 1 March 2026: https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf

### GST calculation policy

Use 18% GST on the applicable, evidence-backed taxable service-charge base, calculated from canonical components once. The working component policy recorded for Upstox is:
- Delivery: brokerage + transaction charges/IPFT + applicable demat transaction charges.
- Intraday, futures and options: brokerage + transaction charges/IPFT.
- Where transaction charges are represented as a combined amount that already includes IPFT, include that combined amount once; do not add IPFT again to the GST base.
- Where the source is split, combine transaction charges excluding IPFT with the separately evidenced IPFT exactly once.
- Apply pure-agent/exclusion treatment only where the applicable tax rule and invoice evidence support it; do not assume every charge is excluded from GST merely because it is statutory or separately labelled.
- Use the applicable product, segment and effective date, with documented rounding and invoice reconciliation. Do not reuse a taxable-base rule across products/dates without evidence.

Reference for published broker treatment: https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/

### Decision versus remaining implementation gates

**Settled policy:** the combined-versus-split IPFT arithmetic above; IPFT must never be counted twice; GST is calculated from the applicable taxable canonical components once; unknown representation fails closed.

**Still required before production approval:** corroborate actual Upstox API/contract-note field semantics against authentic source evidence; approve effective-dated product/segment mappings and GST composition against invoices; test combined/split equivalence and no-double-count behavior in per-fill accounting; and pass exact-head CI. The Upstox Get Trade Charges endpoint is aggregate reconciliation evidence, not proof of actual per-fill charges. Do not label these remaining evidence/implementation gates as a reversal of the agreed calculation policy.

Safety remains unchanged: PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes disabled; PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending review and user approval. All work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.


## Canonical latest Phase 3 checkpoint — 26 October 2026

- **Repository:** `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. **Verified code/evidence head:** `d287da70ce184c904c6f9ede9e4a0edca5839f8f` (commit: “docs: reconcile public Upstox contract note GST examples”).
- **Exact-head CI:** PASS — [GitHub Actions run #40304398632](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40304398632), commit `d287da70ce184c904c6f9ede9e4a0edca5839f8f`; **1,004 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and restore-evidence retention also passed. This is CI evidence, not proof of a real Oracle recovery or broker-origin authenticity.
- **GST/IPFT research:** Three public third-party historical Upstox note copies were reconciled: 11-Feb-2025 base ₹2.97 / IGST ₹0.53; 21-May-2024 base ₹77.56 / IGST ₹13.96 (IPFT ₹0.11 listed outside that note's printed base); 12-Mar-2025 base ₹2.75 / IGST ₹0.50. Printed-base compositions differ historically. The current official Upstox schedule supports the **estimate-only** base of brokerage + transaction charges + demat where applicable + IPFT, with IPFT represented exactly once because it is combined with transaction charges. Do not add SEBI to this current estimate base without current applicable billing evidence; never calculate GST on trade notional or infer zero from missing/null fields.
- **Tax/accounting approval:** all four GST component candidates remain `DRAFT`. Historical public copies do not prove current actual per-fill billing across products/accounts. Actual-charge promotion stays gated; estimate logic and actual invoice reconciliation are distinct. Follow effective dates and preserve raw API/source evidence.
- **Next action when resuming:** continue Phase 3 from this exact commit and checkpoint. Next gate is component-specific GST acceptance cases for equity delivery, intraday, futures and options, then implementation review and exact-head CI; do not restart from earlier saved checkpoints.
- **Safety / PR:** PAPER mode mandatory; live broker `place_order`/`modify_order`/`cancel_order` and automatic live-fill promotion remain disabled. PR #6 remains open, draft and unmerged. Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is not the work target and must remain untouched.
- This checkpoint supersedes older statements in this document about CI being in progress or requiring verification for the pre-`d287da7` head. Historical notes remain history; this is the canonical resume point.


## Session checkpoint sync — 26 October 2026

- Exact-head Backend CI [#40368554399 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40368554399) passed on code head `9d3f255480da9a71980a9d3819fbb69a34835753`. New documentation-sync commits require their own final exact-head CI check.
- Statutory GST research: CBIC stock-broking FAQ and CGST Act section 15 / CGST Rules Rule 33 and Rule 27 govern valuation; pure-agent exclusion is conditional on evidence, not automatic. IGST Act section 12(12) governs stock-broking place of supply; supplier/place-of-supply state comparison determines IGST vs CGST+SGST. Sources: https://cbic-gst.gov.in/sectoral-faq.html ; https://cbic-gst.gov.in/valuation-rules.html
- GST public-schedule helper/tests remain estimate-only. Statutory GST valuation service and tests are not implemented yet; GST/IPFT acceptance remains open. Next: implement Section 15 inclusion, Rule 33 evidence gates, tax-state split, Decimal/paise rounding and fail-closed handling. IPFT combined/separate and DP/demat persistence/reconciliation remain open.
- No personal contract note available or required. Safety: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER-only; live broker order writes disabled; original Tradepro repository out of scope.

## Verified checkpoint — 27 October 2026 (DP/demat completeness)

- Backend CI #40459846143 passed on `9400bc9aa221e2cf3b735e49a8e9a6d351237f02`: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40459846143. Backend tests, broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore checks passed.
- DP completeness API regression added: invalid DP status must not expose a complete total. `KNOWN` requires a valid paise-exact amount; `NOT_APPLICABLE` requires no amount; unresolved states remain incomplete. Delivery SELL needs reviewed DP evidence and exact per-fill allocation.
- Next gate: per-fill mapping, replay/idempotency, rollback atomicity and component applicability. Real invoice and production Oracle restore acceptance remain evidence-gated.
- Safety: PAPER mandatory; live broker writes disabled; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; original `Tradepro` repository out of scope.

## Superseding decision — GST invoice regressions and API evidence scope (27 October 2026)

- The five user-provided January 2023 Upstox daily contract-note fixtures and effective-dated IPFT estimator tests are included in code/test head `fe4c8c484650a8b6e63f822a8c7581431c855d22`.
- Exact-head Backend CI [#40545398934 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40545398934): **1,149 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore checks passed.
- GST daily-invoice calculation is now regression-validated for all five supplied dates. Do not reopen the basic 18% formula as an unresolved research question. The annual AGS two-paise variance remains an aggregate reconciliation note; it is not evidence of a broker error and must not block the GST implementation.
- The Upstox pre-trade brokerage calculator is estimate-only. The post-trade charges endpoint `/v2/trade/profit-loss/charges` is aggregate-only. Preserve these meanings through `broker_charge_api_value_resolution.py`; do not promote either response to per-fill booked charges. Reconcile contract-note actuals at the source's disclosed scope.
- IPFT is not a blocker to the validated GST formula. Use effective-dated IPFT only when the product/segment and source-supported premium basis apply. The supplied January 2023 note text has no separately identified IPFT line, so don't assume either a separately booked IPFT amount or that it is bundled. Preserve it as not separately disclosed; do not synthesize zero or an allocation. If no applicable IPFT rule/component is evidenced for a trade, leave it not applicable/unknown according to the source and product scope rather than holding up GST.
- The guarded estimator is for estimate calculation only and requires an approved effective-dated tariff rule and explicit scope. It does not activate a production tariff or prove historical booked IPFT.
- Next Phase 3 work should proceed to the remaining accounting acceptance gates (fill identity, replay/idempotency, atomic rollback and component applicability), while using these GST tests as regression coverage. Only revisit IPFT when an applicable source-backed tariff or actual source field requires it.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` out of scope; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes disabled.


## API-first paper-trade charge estimation decision — 29 October 2026

- User-approved behavior: use Upstox's pre-trade Brokerage Details API for paper-fill charge estimates when it returns a complete, valid, internally consistent breakdown. Keep the existing deterministic local calculator as the automatic fallback if the API is unavailable, expired/unauthorized, incomplete, null/invalid, or inconsistent. This is estimation only, not live-trading/accounting promotion.
- Implementation added on the Phase 3 branch: `backend/app/services/paper_trade_charge_estimator.py` plus deterministic tests. `ExecutionService` now uses API-first estimates for market and matched limit paper fills and records `PAPER_UPSTOX_API_ESTIMATE` versus `PAPER_ESTIMATE` in the existing execution charge-source field. Components are accepted only when paise-exact supported components sum exactly to the API total; transaction, clearing and IPFT are combined once in the existing exchange-charge field. Unknown/incomplete fields fall back rather than block paper trading.
- Existing post-trade Upstox charges endpoint remains aggregate reconciliation evidence, not per-fill actuals. The API route already exists. GST reconciliation remains available without blocking paper-trade P&L.
- Implementation commits: `b90c09dc82a51181bc9eae422cb025eb79c65bcb`; default-enabled setting `UPSTOX_CHARGE_ESTIMATES_ENABLED`. CI disables network estimates only for the broad execution suite; mocked estimator tests cover API and fallback paths.
- Backend CI [#40755234415](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40755234415) — **SUCCESS** on code/test head `778e76d3554a3baedc41f0396276c1cb3dafc38f`: **1,197 passed, 1 warning**; broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore/evidence retention passed. Documentation sync head `d57dd476ecd6acebd4dc9e169912b877811a8166` still needs exact-head CI verification before it is called green.
- Next: continue the next uncovered Phase 3 accounting acceptance gate after CI recovery. Do not reopen GST/IPFT from zero or make minor estimate variance a paper-trading blocker. Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes disabled; original `Tradepro` out of scope.


## Authoritative Phase 3 engineering closure — 29 October 2026

This section supersedes older status/next-step notes above; earlier entries remain as historical audit trail.

**Status: Phase 3 engineering acceptance is complete for the agreed PAPER-mode scope.** This is not authorization to enable live broker writes, promote estimates to booked actuals, or merge Draft PRs.

**Verified code checkpoint:** `3a0c464afcb10261d1590607f8440affd21295a0`, Backend CI [#40878367369 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40878367369): **1,207 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary, SQLite upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, and restore-evidence retention passed. The new documentation head still requires its own CI run.

### Completed engineering scope

- Paise-exact deterministic per-fill allocation; source integrity/reviewer controls; canonical source-to-component mapping; explicit combined/split transaction-charge/IPFT handling.
- Idempotent replay and conflicting-replay rejection; locked charge verification; rollback protection for accounting/position mutation.
- Explicit DP/demat persistence and total completeness. Delivery SELL fails closed when required DP evidence is unknown, invalid, inconsistent, or missing.
- GST valuation and GST/API comparison primitives preserve Decimal/paise precision, state/place-of-supply, missing/null/zero distinctions, and review-required variances. They do not silently approve actual charges.
- Upstox Brokerage Details API first for PAPER estimates; hardcoded calculator fallback on unavailable/invalid/inconsistent responses. Persist source as `PAPER_UPSTOX_API_ESTIMATE` or `PAPER_HARDCODED_FALLBACK` and display: “Estimated charges may differ from actual broker charges. For paper trading only; these are not actual booked charges.”
- Post-trade Trade Charges API is aggregate-only evidence, never per-fill actuals; aggregate responses are sanitized before persistence/return.

### Non-blocking operational/release gates

Credentialed Upstox OAuth/API smoke testing and real Oracle/database-plus-document-volume restore acceptance require deployment and user-authorized credentials/backups. Tariffs without independently approved scope/date evidence remain estimate-only/fail-closed for actual accounting. Historical contract-note fixtures support regression tests; estimates and aggregate summaries never become booked per-fill actuals. These constraints do not block PAPER-mode engineering completion.

**Safety:** only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes disabled. Phase 4 is the next separate increment after exact documentation-head CI passes.


## Resume checkpoint — 29 October 2026 (Upstox response-schema validation)

- **Code/test head:** `404c1e11ef4f2557c791c720c8d9a3fbc4e93bc1`; exact-head Backend CI [#40883660756 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40883660756). The workflow result confirms success; its summary did not expose a reliable pytest count, so no count is asserted here.
- **Concrete fix:** `UpstoxChargeApiOrchestrationService` no longer marks arbitrary successful HTTP JSON as usable. Brokerage estimates require `status == "success"` and `data.charges`; post-trade aggregate charges require `status == "success"` and `data.charges_breakdown`. Wrong/missing schema returns `usable=false`, clears the payload and records `INVALID_RESPONSE_SCHEMA`.
- **Regression coverage:** valid endpoint-specific response fixtures plus incorrect endpoint schema, unsuccessful/missing status, and aggregate wrong-shape payload cases.
- **Evidence boundary:** Brokerage Details remains estimate-only; Trade Charges remains aggregate reconciliation-only and never per-fill actual evidence. Null IPFT must not be silently coerced to zero. This fix validates response shape; it does not approve tariffs or promote accounting.
- **Contract-note continuity:** previously supplied January 2023 Upstox/RKSV contract-note examples remain available as historical regression fixtures; do not ask the user to provide them again. Their scope must be respected when using them for GST totals versus per-fill allocations.
- **Next:** verify CI on the exact synchronized documentation head. Keep PR #6/#7 Draft and unmerged, PAPER mode mandatory, live broker writes disabled, and the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository untouched.


## Phase 4 current checkpoint — 30 October 2026

The transactional PAPER stop-event claim implementation at `6ac3882a98f3c66abb4cd62848971b6277ab3be7` passed exact-head Backend CI #41080156436. The claim service validates tenant and strategy ownership, uses portfolio → strategy → position locks, rejects ambiguous shared-position ownership and duplicate quote identity, and stores a bounded claim lease. It is not connected to quote dispatch or order execution. Next gates: PostgreSQL 16 multi-worker concurrency, lease reclaim/crash recovery, explicit shared-position ownership, then controlled PAPER integration. PR #9 stays Draft/unmerged; PAPER-only; live broker writes disabled; original Tradepro repository out of scope.
