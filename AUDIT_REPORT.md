# Tradepro Improved — Audit and Change Log

Audit target: `main` in this repository. The original `Tradepro` repository is read-only and has not been modified.

## Current findings

| Area / requirement | Status | Evidence / next action |
|---|---|---|
| FastAPI APIs, SQLAlchemy models/repositories | Existing; tests pass | Backend test suite passed on the current backend changes. Continue adding coverage as features change. |
| Paper market orders | Implemented, still needs operational validation | Uses Upstox LTP for simulated fills and records transaction costs and position/cash updates. Never fall back to a made-up price. |
| Order input validation | Improved | Service boundary rejects non-positive quantities, unsupported order types, missing/non-positive LIMIT prices, and a limit price attached to MARKET orders. API schema also rejects non-positive limit prices. |
| Quote price parsing | Improved | Rejects malformed, non-finite, zero, and negative LTP values before paper accounting. |
| Paper limit orders | Implemented; tests passed | Worker checks pending PAPER LIMIT orders during market passes, fills only when LTP crosses the limit, uses limit-or-better pricing, shares cost/cash/position accounting, and rejects delivery sells without holdings. Owners can cancel pending orders from the portfolio page. |
| Live order placement | Incomplete / not enabled | Shared execution service still records PAPER orders; broker order placement and execution reconciliation are not complete. Do not enable live orders. |
| Strategy activation | Fixed | Strategy evaluation returns HOLD for inactive strategies before contacting the broker; regression test added. |
| Daily risk controls | Partial | Existing strategy-level daily-loss guard remains. An environment-controlled emergency switch now blocks new automated strategy entries while allowing exits. Portfolio-wide loss, exposure, and order-frequency caps still need implementation and tests. |
| Broker OAuth | Improved | State is signed, expires after 10 minutes, and is bound to user/broker/connection. A nonce digest and expiry are persisted and consumed by a conditional database update, so repeated/concurrent callback attempts cannot consume the same state twice. |
| OAuth schema migration | Added; deployment not yet verified | `202608220001_oauth_state_replay.py` adds the two nullable state columns. Apply and verify migrations in a backup-safe staging environment before deploying to an existing database. |
| Upstox instrument sync / streaming | Missing | Adapter still has unimplemented instrument-sync and market-data-streaming work. Implement against current official API documentation and test with paper data. |
| Frontend dashboard | Improved | Root page is now a dashboard with portfolio/cash summaries and links to portfolios, backtests, news, broker settings, and notifications. It no longer duplicates the broker settings page. |
| Frontend typecheck/build | Verified in CI | TypeScript check and Next.js production build passed. The `lint` script runs TypeScript checking because the project uses Next.js 16, where the old `next lint` command is not available. |
| Database migrations | CI migration check passed on SQLite; staging still required | The full Alembic chain, including the OAuth nonce migration, successfully upgraded a clean SQLite database in CI. Verify against a backup and staging copy of the actual deployment database before production rollout. |

## Changes committed

1. Added a service-level inactive-strategy guard and a regression test.
2. Added signed, expiring OAuth state validation bound to the requesting user and broker connection.
3. Added persisted, one-time OAuth nonce consumption with an atomic conditional update and Alembic migration.
4. Added order validation at both the API schema and execution-service boundary.
5. Hardened last-traded-price parsing so invalid prices cannot enter paper-accounting calculations.
6. Added a worker-driven paper LIMIT matcher with crossing rules, limit-or-better pricing, cash/holding checks, and shared accounting.
7. Added an authenticated cancel endpoint and portfolio UI action for pending paper orders, with ownership and status checks.
8. Replaced the duplicate root broker-settings page with an account dashboard.
9. Updated the frontend check command for Next.js 16.
11. Added an environment-controlled emergency kill switch for automated strategy entries, with a regression test proving it blocks entry without creating a position; exits remain available.
10. Added GitHub Actions workflows for backend tests and frontend typecheck/build.

## Verification

- **Backend:** GitHub Actions run passed — **167 tests passed, 1 deprecation warning**, including the paper LIMIT matcher tests. [View backend run](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39025837191).
- **Frontend:** TypeScript check and Next.js production build passed. [View frontend run](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39025402726).
- The tests use SQLite and mocked broker calls; they do not prove a live Upstox session or live market-order execution works.
- The OAuth migration passed a clean SQLite upgrade in CI but has not been applied to your production database.
- No live orders have been submitted.

## Remaining high-priority work

1. Add durable order idempotency/reconciliation before any live-trading implementation. The automated-entry kill switch is now present but must be included in deployment configuration and operational runbooks.
2. Add portfolio-wide loss/exposure controls and an exchange holiday calendar.
3. Implement instrument master sync and WebSocket market data using current official Upstox documentation.
4. Verify the Alembic migration path in staging and check the current deployment configuration.
5. Review remaining analytics and backtest behavior against the requested product requirements.


## Requirements-to-code/test gap map (reviewed 2026-10-17)

This is a repository-source review, not a live-broker certification. The current backend CI run for commit `a8faa2581a05778df0f7d30a7a0fb3f0d4e6164a` completed successfully (workflow run [39036087413](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39036087413)). That run was triggered by documentation changes; it confirms the existing test workflow is green, not that untested live-trading features work.

| Requirement | Source evidence reviewed | Status | Next safe action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paper orders must not submit real orders | `backend/app/services/execution_service.py` constructs orders with `trading_mode="PAPER"`; `backend/app/brokers/base.py` defines broker placement separately | Existing separation; add an explicit regression test that PAPER execution never calls adapter `place_order` | Inspect existing test coverage and add a mock assertion if absent |
| Live order lifecycle and reconciliation | `ExecutionService.place_order` simulates accounting; adapter has `place_order`, `get_order_status`, `get_order_book`, `get_positions`, but no live orchestration service was found in reviewed files | Not implemented / not enabled | Design a separate live execution service only after idempotency, risk and broker rules are specified; no real orders in tests |
| Duplicate submission protection | `Order` model has no visible broker idempotency key in reviewed fields; safeguards document calls this out | Gap | Define unique client intent key + persisted submission state and retry semantics before live execution |
| Strategy-specific daily loss | `backend/app/services/risk_engine.py` checks strategy's realized loss today | Partial, strategy-level only | Preserve and test; clarify UTC calendar-day vs Indian exchange session day |
| Portfolio-wide loss / exposure / order-frequency caps | Not present in reviewed `risk_engine.py`; architecture/audit also list as remaining work | Gap | Design Decimal-based limits and account/portfolio aggregation; add tests for threshold, boundary, concurrent entry and fail-closed behavior |
| Emergency stop for automated entries | `backend/app/core/config.py` exposes `AUTOMATED_ENTRIES_ENABLED`; `strategy_execution_service.py` blocks entries while preserving exits | Implemented for automated strategy entries, not manual paper orders or live orders | Add runbook/monitoring; do not describe as a global account-wide live kill switch |
| Upstox instrument master | `backend/app/services/instrument_service.py::sync_from_upstox` downloads `https://assets.upstox.com/market-quote/instruments/exchange/complete.json.gz`, decompresses JSON and imports `NSE_EQ`; `adapter.py::sync_instruments` is still a stub | Partial | Official docs confirm JSON BOD files and recommend `instrument_key`; mocked parser and failed-download tests pass in CI. Next design multi-segment mapping and safe deactivation/expiry handling before expanding scope. See [official Upstox Instruments docs](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/instruments/).
| Upstox WebSocket market data | Adapter stream URL method returns an explicit not-implemented result; no complete stream client verified in this review | Gap | Confirm current official authorization handshake and message schema; implement reconnect/heartbeat/stale-data handling and mocked tests |
| OAuth replay prevention | Audit documents persisted nonce digest, expiry and conditional consumption; migration file exists | CI clean-SQLite tested; production/staging not verified | Backup and validate upgrade against a staging copy of the actual DB before deployment |
| Production migration safety | Existing clean SQLite migration CI is not equivalent to the deployed DB engine/data | Unverified | Record DB engine/version, backup, staging upgrade and rollback plan before deployment |
| Frontend checks | Existing CI reports typecheck and production build | Historical CI reported green; no frontend changes in this audit step | Keep CI required for future frontend changes |

### Review sequence / acceptance gates

1. Add or verify the paper/live adapter isolation regression test. It must fail if a PAPER order path calls `BrokerAdapter.place_order`.
2. Add portfolio-level risk controls in a separate, testable risk module only after defining how realized and unrealized P&L, open orders, positions, and time-zone/session boundaries are calculated.
3. Add instrument sync and streaming separately, against current official Upstox docs and mocked fixtures.
4. Treat idempotent live order submission, broker reconciliation, account-level emergency stop, static-IP/2FA/session requirements, authorization and applicable compliance review as mandatory blockers before any real-order feature.
5. Run full backend/frontend CI after code changes; do not call CI triggered by docs a code regression test.

### Scope boundary

The audit documentation itself does not change application behavior. This work session added focused tests only; the instrument-sync implementation itself was not expanded. No live orders were submitted. No production or staging migration was run. Live trading remains unimplemented and must remain disabled.
