# Tradepro Improved

A separate improvement track for Tradepro. The original `Tradepro` repository and its `main` branch remain untouched.

## Safety-first development rules

- Preserve existing functionality while fixing verified defects.
- Keep paper trading as the default mode.
- Keep live trading disabled until broker execution, order reconciliation, duplicate-order prevention, risk limits, and an emergency kill switch are implemented and tested.
- Never commit API tokens, OAuth secrets, passwords, or other credentials.
- Validate changes with automated tests and build checks before deploying.

## Current status

The original source tree has been imported into this repository. Recent improvements include:
- A dashboard at `/` with portfolio summaries and navigation.
- Backend input validation for orders and rejection of invalid broker prices.
- One-time, expiring broker OAuth state backed by a database nonce digest.
- Paper LIMIT-order matching in the worker, using the shared transaction-cost, cash and position accounting.
- Automated backend and frontend checks in GitHub Actions.
- An environment-controlled emergency kill switch blocks new strategy entries when `AUTOMATED_ENTRIES_ENABLED=false`; strategy exits remain enabled.

See [AUDIT_REPORT.md](./AUDIT_REPORT.md) for findings, verification links and remaining work.

## Important trading behavior

- **Paper market orders:** use a current Upstox quote for the simulated fill; the application does not invent a price when the quote is unavailable or invalid. The quote parser requires the exact requested instrument key and will not substitute another instrument's price if that key is missing.
- **Paper limit orders:** remain pending until the worker checks them during market hours (about every 5 minutes). A BUY can fill when LTP is at or below its limit; a SELL can fill when LTP is at or above its limit. The matcher uses the shared accounting engine, checks available cash / delivery holdings, and users can cancel pending orders from the portfolio order history.
- **Emergency kill switch:** set `AUTOMATED_ENTRIES_ENABLED=false` in the backend environment and restart the API/worker to stop automated strategy entries. Existing strategy exits are intentionally not blocked. This switch does not stop manual paper orders.
- **Live trading:** is **not implemented** by the shared execution service. Setting `TRADING_MODE=LIVE` is not sufficient to make real broker orders happen; do not treat this repository as ready for live trading.
- **Portfolio settings:** each portfolio has a manual settings form for renaming and optional risk controls: maximum daily realized loss, estimated open exposure, per-order value, simultaneous open/pending positions and orders per day. Controls are disabled until enabled. Limits are checked for paper manual and strategy orders; closing/reducing orders are allowed. Exposure is a conservative cost-basis estimate, not broker margin.
- **Upstox WebSocket:** authenticated endpoints are POST /api/v1/market-data/stream, GET /api/v1/market-data/stream, and DELETE /api/v1/market-data/stream. The portfolio order form has Start/Stop controls for the selected instrument and displays fresh LTP updates. Subscribe only to active catalog keys. Streams are process-local and disappear on API restart; use one API worker until a shared stream/cache layer is added. ExecutionService uses fresh stream ticks when available and otherwise falls back to REST.
- **Instrument sync:** admin POST /api/v1/instruments/sync now reconciles absent/expired instruments only after a completeness gate passes. A separate GitHub Actions workflow successfully downloaded the real official Upstox master and synced it into temporary in-memory SQLite (123,930 active instruments); it never touched production.
- **Migration/deployment:** the portfolio-risk migration is CI-tested on clean SQLite. Back up the deployed database and verify alembic upgrade head in staging before deploying to an existing database.
- **Remaining work:** live order placement/reconciliation, idempotency and duplicate-order protection, a global account-level live-trading kill switch, exchange holiday calendar, real authenticated WebSocket verification with a user OAuth session, multi-worker stream sharing, and staging migration verification. Live trading is not implemented and must remain disabled.


## Verified status — 17 October 2026
- Latest backend CI after documentation updates: [run 39039714203](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39039714203) — **203 tests passed, 1 warning**; clean SQLite Alembic migration verification passed.
- Safety regression coverage includes exact-instrument quote matching, portfolio order-count cap, incomplete instrument snapshot rejection, WebSocket silence reconnect, and V3 authorization URL validation.
- Official Upstox instrument master was downloaded and synchronized into a disposable in-memory SQLite database: **123,930 active instruments** ([verification workflow](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39037390129)). This did not modify production data.
- Frontend TypeScript/build verification for the stream controls passed ([run 39037642093](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39037642093)).
- **Not production-ready for live trading:** real OAuth WebSocket verification, multi-worker stream sharing, backup-safe staging migration, idempotent live submission and broker reconciliation remain open. Keep live trading disabled; no live orders have been submitted.
