## GST/IPFT statutory-engine implementation update — 26 October 2026 (code/test CI passed; docs head must be checked)

- Added `backend/app/services/statutory_stock_broking_gst.py` and `backend/tests/test_statutory_stock_broking_gst.py` on the current Phase 3 branch. The service implements CGST Act section 15's default taxable valuation, conditional CGST Rule 33 pure-agent exclusion requiring every evidence flag, and IGST Act section 12(12) recipient-location/fallback state selection for IGST versus CGST+SGST.
- Service/test changes are in commits `dcad71e148b89a2c384631b36090008c8fad193e` and `037ad2da02dca34c399e0ec454674c50ae65b5a7`, included in the verified checkpoint head above. Exact-head Backend CI [#40375335160 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40375335160) passed on checkpoint head `cc2d591cf74daea5d68b6ba704ae87a342cc96fd`: **1,051 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips and synthetic restore drill passed. Later documentation commits are newer and still require exact-head CI verification.
- The statutory engine is a separate primitive and is not yet wired into actual per-fill accounting. It does not infer Rule 33 pure-agent status from a charge label; absent complete evidence, third-party recovery lines remain in the section 15 base. It keeps the Upstox published-schedule estimate separate from statutory valuation and does not override the unresolved API sample discrepancy.
- Regression coverage added for combined/separate exchange/IPFT values in the taxable base, Rule 33 all-conditions gate, same-state versus cross-state tax type, recipient-state fallback, invalid/missing money, duplicate line names, and paise rounding. Intra-state CGST/SGST tax heads are rounded independently to paise and the returned total equals the two heads.
- Remaining gates: run exact-head backend CI and fix failures; independently review tax-head rounding and legal policy; implement product/broker effective-dated mapping and IPFT resolver; complete DP/demat persistence + total reconciliation; integrate only reviewed policy paths; synchronize this checkpoint again to the final CI-verified head. Actual per-fill invoice evidence remains deferred until source records/deployment exist; no personal contract note is required.
- Official source basis: [CBIC stock-broking FAQ](https://cbic-gst.gov.in/sectoral-faq.html), [CGST Act section 15](https://cbic-gst.gov.in/hindi/CGST-bill-e.html), [Upstox Brokerage Details API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/), and [Upstox public charges](https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/).
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6/#7 Draft and unmerged; PAPER-only; live broker writes disabled; original `Tradepro` untouched.
## Latest authoritative checkpoint — 26 October 2026, 21:06 IST

This section supersedes earlier statements in this file that identify an older commit or CI run as the latest checkpoint. Historical entries below are retained for audit history.
- **Verified Phase 3 correction — 26 Oct 2026, 22:45 IST:** backend CI [#40366645906 PASSED](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40366645906) on code head `f9d302fce03e504985e96582a7af71b14fd89f28`: 1,034 passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore drill passed. Fix: DP/demat optional amount now reads from `optional_canonical_components`; live snapshot materialization remains limited to the core six-component map. This green run verifies the correction, not completion of GST/IPFT acceptance. Current work remains Phase 3; PR #7 Draft/unmerged, PAPER-only, live writes disabled.

- **Latest GST/IPFT working update — 26 Oct 2026:** working branch is `phase3/cross-broker-gst-ipft-resolution`, PR #7 remains Draft/unmerged. A failed backend run #40365836710 (46 failed, 988 passed) exposed a DP/demat optional-component `KeyError` because the allocation planner read the six-component amount map for an optional amount. Fixes on the current branch separate `optional_canonical_components` and make the allocation planner read that map for DP/demat; snapshot materialization iterates only the six-component canonical source map. Latest code change at time of update: `c0607aff672a9792410513e7564cd5f3c8d7f371`. Exact-head CI has not yet been confirmed; this is not a green checkpoint. Do not claim success until the current head's backend tests and safety/migration checks pass. PAPER-only; live broker writes remain disabled; do not modify original `Tradepro`.


- **Only target repository:** [tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved). Branch: `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. Latest documentation commit before this sync: `73c4a7cdcde4490bd520d5e75cc87fe1b4ffa310`. Exact-head documentation CI [#40346810442 PASSED](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40346810442).
- GST estimate implementation commit `b75a97f6cd0043c185375cc253b84a1e6d6bfea1`; exact-head CI [#40345937942 PASSED](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40345937942): 1,012 tests passed, 1 warning. Broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore/evidence-retention checks passed.
- **GST estimate decision:** apply 18% to brokerage + combined exchange transaction/IPFT charge exactly once; include explicit demat/DP charges additionally for equity delivery. Do not add STT, stamp duty, SEBI or trade notional to this published GST estimate base. Upstox's Brokerage Details API sample arithmetic conflicts with the explicit public schedule; the sample does not override the schedule or prove live billing is wrong. Sources: [Upstox pricing](https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/), [Brokerage Details API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/), [Trades Charges API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-charges/), [NSE transaction/IPFT circular](https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf).
- **New Phase 3 gap found:** `demat_transaction_charges` is intentionally blocked by source-to-canonical mapping; canonical live accounting and `Execution` currently support six components only. Equity-delivery actual-charge accounting with a DP/demat charge is therefore not accepted yet. The estimate helper can include a demat amount, but that does not mean actual accounting can persist/reconcile it. Keep this fail-closed; do not drop DP charges or fold them into another component. Next implementation gate: product-aware canonical demat/DP component and total-charge persistence, migration, idempotency, allocation, and delivery/non-delivery regression tests—or keep delivery actual accounting unsupported until complete.
- Actual per-fill GST/invoice acceptance remains evidence-gated. Public schedules and calculators support estimates, not account-specific actuals; aggregate API values and null fields are not per-fill invoice proof. User is not required to provide a personal contract note. Actual tariff candidates remain DRAFT.
- Phase 3 remains IN PROGRESS; PR #6 remains open/draft/unmerged. PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes, automatic live-fill promotion and automatic scheduling remain disabled. Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` must not be modified. AI/Algory integrations remain deferred until Phase 3 acceptance.

## Historical checkpoint (superseded) — 26 October 2026 (latest verified CI)

- Target repository only: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; branch `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`; implementation/test head `44830ec48b50b4f470ec9ca95dd2d3f4339dd3df`. Do not modify original `Tradepro`.
- Exact-head Backend CI: [run #40294178677 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40294178677). This includes the updated test separating NSE/IPFT arithmetic reconciliation from GST taxable-base approval.
- GST estimate helper accepts exactly 18%; tests reject 0%, 5%, 100%, and 100.01%. This is a rate guard only; taxable component composition remains evidence/reviewer-controlled.
- NSE/IPFT reconciliation of ₹307/crore versus ₹306.99/crore transaction charge + ₹0.01/crore IPFT is arithmetic only; it does not approve either component's GST treatment.
- Canonical live-fill integration is already verified: six independently verified charge snapshots; source hashes/links/mapping version, reviewed fill manifest/weights, INR totals, reconciliation and contract-note reference revalidated under lock; no raw-only fallback. Brokerage cap applied once before deterministic paise-exact allocation by reviewed weights.
- Remaining Phase 3 gates: effective-dated tariff applicability; component-specific per-fill allocation acceptance; invoice/source-backed GST/IPFT and product/segment evidence; adversarial/migration/recovery review; final exact-head docs/sign-off. Do not redo canonical integration.
- Upstox calculator/public schedules are estimates; aggregate charges endpoint is not actual per-fill evidence. Preserve null as unknown, never zero. Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle recovery.
- PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes, automatic live-fill promotion and automatic scheduling disabled. PR #6 open/draft/unmerged unless explicitly approved. Defer AI/open-source adaptations until Phase 3 acceptance. Documentation commit needs its own exact-head CI.

## Canonical checkpoint reconciliation — 26 October 2026 (canonical live-fill integration verified)

- **Repository:** `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. Never modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- **Latest verified implementation head before this documentation sync:** `255fc208eed4bc8b922977717209d27912055377`. Exact-head Backend CI [run #40286205714 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40286205714): **962 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, and restore-evidence retention all passed. Synthetic restore does not prove actual Oracle Cloud recovery.
- **PR #6:** open, draft, unmerged. Do not merge without explicit user approval.
- **Phase 3 integration completed on this head:** `LiveFillAccountingService` now requires exactly six independently verified canonical charge snapshots. It revalidates each canonical ledger and its source hashes/links/mapping version, reviewed fill manifest and weights, INR totals, durable reconciliation references, and the contract-note reference under lock. There is no fallback to raw-only legacy allocation rows. Extra, unmapped, unlinked, or foreign-connection per-fill allocations fail closed.
- **Integration tests:** canonical snapshot creation → independent review → allocation → reconciliation; direct and combined/split transaction/IPFT source lines canonicalize to one exchange-charge component; exact replay, missing/unreconciled/extra allocations, and PostgreSQL live-fill-versus-ledger promotion race. No live broker order writes are enabled.
- **Remaining Phase 3 gates:** (2) independently reviewed effective-dated tariff applicability; (3) approved component-specific per-fill allocation rules; (4) invoice/source-backed GST/IPFT and product-specific component acceptance; (6) final adversarial, migration and recovery review; (7) exact-head documentation/sign-off. Official public tariff snapshots are research evidence, not proof of account-specific actual charges; candidate rates remain DRAFT until the required review is recorded. Synthetic restore is not a real Oracle recovery test.
- **Upstox controls:** no unused SDK runtime dependency; Agent Skill remains development/static-review-only; brokerage calculator is estimate-only; aggregate charge endpoints are not per-fill actual evidence.
- **Safety invariants:** PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes, automatic live-fill promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. Keep PR #6 unmerged until explicit approval.
- **Next step:** resume at the remaining Phase 3 tariff/component evidence gates. Do not repeat canonical snapshot integration. Do not begin the separate AI/open-source adaptations until Phase 3 acceptance is complete.
- **Documentation-sync note:** this multi-document commit must pass its own exact-head CI before the next implementation change.

# Changelog

Changes that materially affect safety, accounting, integrations, or acceptance gates are recorded here.

## 2026-10-24 — Phase 3 accounting acceptance and Upstox source register

- Added `UPSTOX_CHARGE_RULE_SOURCE_REGISTER.md` to separate broker estimates, realized charge evidence, and effective-dated tariff rules.
- Recorded the official Upstox Brokerage Details API and Profit and Loss on Trades API as relevant integration/evidence sources, with strict limits on what each source proves.
- Kept all tariff candidates DRAFT/non-selectable until authoritative source documents, effective dates, applicability, calculation bases, rounding and independent review are recorded.
- Verified the variance rollback regression fix at code commit `5e036d7fcc1f5f439d4054700366d284d7b78061`: Backend CI #40096380843 passed 793 tests with 1 warning; broker-write guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks and synthetic restore drill passed.
- Latest documentation-only commits have not yet received a fresh exact-head CI result. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled.
- Scope: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## 2026-10-24 — Reviewed fill-ID input validation hardening

- Added defensive validation in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_source_reconciliation_service.py`: each reviewed allocation-weight `fill_record_id` must be a string before UUID parsing. This prevents malformed JSON values such as `null`, numbers, or arrays from escaping the expected validation path as an unexpected exception.
- Added parameterized regression coverage in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_source_reconciliation_service.py` for `null`, numeric, and list-valued fill IDs. Expected behavior is a controlled `ValueError`; no allocation is promoted by this validation path.
- Code commit: `10febb7a14c779ab7e308b9175ff4f16ad5fec44`; regression test commit: `067e76687eda71aa81aae1df6b8b16133cf42d86`.
- CI for this new code/test head is not yet reported by GitHub Actions at the time of this note; the previous 793-pass run does not verify these new changes. Combined commit status currently reports no status checks for the new head, so this fix remains unverified pending CI.
- Phase 3 remains open: effective-dated tariff source approval, per-fill accounting acceptance, exact-head CI and final PR review remain required. PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled.
- Repository boundary remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.


## 2026-10-24 — Reviewed fill-ID validation CI result

- Exact code/test head `ddeed926a16f235de777025db1053d9e110bbc11` passed GitHub Actions run [#40099389651](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40099389651).
- Result: **796 passed, 1 warning in 43.75s**. Broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed; synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill passed.
- This CI includes the new parameterized regression tests rejecting malformed reviewed `fill_record_id` values (null, numeric, list) before UUID parsing. It does not yet include the documentation-only updates made after this code/test head.
- Phase 3 remains open: component-by-component per-fill accounting acceptance, authoritative effective-dated tariff evidence and independent review, and final PR gates remain outstanding. Tariff candidates stay DRAFT/non-selectable. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled.
- Scope guard: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` must remain untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Invalid reviewed-weight regression coverage

- Added regression tests in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_source_reconciliation_service.py` for negative weights, non-finite weights (`NaN`, `Infinity`), malformed decimal values, all-zero weight sets, and duplicate fill IDs in the reviewed weights manifest.
- Each case must fail closed before allocation promotion and leave ledger rows in `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`.
- Test commit: `cb577cd1c917da9f2af1e5a01607dd42377067ca`. GitHub Actions backend workflow #40099823190 was still running at the time of this documentation update; do not treat the prior 796-pass run as verification of these new tests. The new documentation commits will also require exact-head CI verification.
- Phase 3 remains open: allocation acceptance, authoritative effective-dated tariff evidence and independent review, exact-head CI, and final PR gates are pending. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled.
- Scope guard: work only in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` must remain untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Reviewed-weight validation tests CI verified

- Backend workflow [#40099906234](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40099906234) passed for code/test head `0d563f060055bb31c14a20f407a5f4b577843d48`: **802 passed, 1 warning in 48.62s**.
- The run includes the new invalid reviewed-weight regression cases (negative, NaN, Infinity, malformed decimal, all-zero and duplicate fill IDs), in addition to the malformed fill-ID tests. Broker-write boundary guard passed and synthetic restore-drill evidence was uploaded. The workflow also exercised PostgreSQL 16 migration downgrade/upgrade checks.
- This run verifies the code/test head before this documentation update, not the documentation commits below. A fresh exact-head CI result is required before treating the current branch tip as fully verified.
- Phase 3 remains open: per-component accounting acceptance and authoritative, effective-dated tariff evidence with independent review remain pending. PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled.
- Repository scope is `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. Do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.


## 2026-10-24 — NSE IPFT representation reconciliation

- Added source-backed policy to `docs/UPSTOX_CHARGE_RULE_SOURCE_REGISTER.md` in commit `295535e032a7ea542b67766c17e5186a83d54409`.
- NSE Circular NSE/FA/73061 confirms totals effective 1 March 2026: ₹307/crore cash, ₹183/crore equity futures, and ₹3,553/crore equity-option premium. Each splits into transaction-only ₹306.99/₹182.99/₹3,552.99 plus IPFT ₹0.01/crore.
- Upstox's public percentages are combined totals for those scopes; do not add IPFT a second time. Separate API fields require raw-response preservation and reconciliation to a dated contract note before canonical mapping approval.
- Documentation/research only: tariff candidates remain DRAFT, PR #6 remains draft/unmerged, live broker order submission remains disabled. Exact-head CI is required for this documentation commit.

## 2026-10-24 — IPFT combined-rate regression tests

- Added tests asserting NSE combined rates remain DRAFT/non-selectable, that no second IPFT tariff candidate is stacked on the combined rate, that GST base/amount are invariant between combined and split representations, and that NSE rates do not leak into MCX scope.
- Test commit: `69945f4854ea8ae7d20e7795b156750406759df7`.
- Updated source register with test scope and limitations in commit `626298aa9d8c60712189a744c86a3327eac1bb50`.
- These are synthetic consistency tests, not proof of live Upstox API field semantics or actual account-specific GST treatment. Exact-head CI is required; candidates remain DRAFT and PR #6 remains draft/unmerged.


## 2026-10-24 — IPFT exact-head CI result

- Recorded passing workflow #40101490646 for commit `a8166bafe77544bf958d0d393b71432379898b72`: 805 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard and migration/restore checks passed.
- This CI result does not approve tariff candidates or establish live API field semantics/GST mapping. Candidates remain DRAFT, PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and live broker order submission remains disabled.


## 2026-10-24 — Historical Upstox statement evidence

- Recorded a user-provided redacted FY 2022–23 RKSV/Upstox Annual Global Transaction Statement screenshot in `docs/UPSTOX_CHARGE_RULE_SOURCE_REGISTER.md`, commit `9bb2fade8330e068022e5b2f6be0538e4f19206e`.
- The summary shows ₹111.61 transaction charges and no separately labelled IPFT row. This is not proof of bundling or API semantics; it is not an individual trade contract note. No actual per-fill charges are promoted and no tariff candidate is activated.

## 2026-10-24 — NSE IPFT rule clarified in source register

- Added the effective-dated scope and no-double-counting rule for NSE combined exchange outflow rates from 2026-03-01 to `UPSTOX_CHARGE_RULE_SOURCE_REGISTER.md`.
- The existing candidate implementation/tests already represent covered NSE rates as `exchange_charges` and assert that no separate `ipft` candidate is added. Candidate rules remain DRAFT/non-selectable; no live tariff activation.
- Source register commit: `6c85292d07d33e1e873293c40931895674f4e7fc`. Exact-head CI for this documentation checkpoint remains required.

## 2026-10-24 — Upstox response semantics and BSE/MCX scope

- Documented the distinction between Upstox's order-specific brokerage estimate and segment/FY trade-charge summary; missing/null/zero/numeric IPFT values must not be conflated.
- Added a secondary public schedule cross-check for BSE scrip/index-specific and MCX commodity rate boundaries; these remain research leads pending the governing exchange circulars.
- Source register commit: 2f6e55532e9704d4b41c9c736c38b1948ee5f05d. CI for this latest documentation head remains to be verified; no tariff candidates activated.

## 2026-10-24 — BSE/MCX tariff scope review

- Added official-source review notes for BSE scrip-group/exclusivity handling, BSE SENSEX monthly incremental slab mechanics, and MCX statutory charge scope. Source register commit: f978052402b2be79d99958427092a29eace83859.
- No generic BSE/MCX rates activated because the reviewed material does not prove all current effective-dated product schedules. Exact-head CI pending verification.


## 2026-10-24 — Exact-head Phase 3 CI and per-fill acceptance audit

- Verified open PR #6 head `5e256bc867409672a19025f0219c9d9c866ce898` with successful Backend tests workflow [#40105708790](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40105708790).
- Audited existing regression coverage for reviewed fill manifests/weights, source-document integrity, source-total and per-fill arithmetic, idempotent atomic promotion, authorization and rollback failures, and variance-only comparisons. No duplicate tests added in this checkpoint.
- Remaining gates are accounting policy acceptance by component, effective-dated authoritative tariff and GST mapping evidence, independent review, and final PR decision. Public tariff pages and the historical annual statement are not per-fill proof. Tariff candidates remain DRAFT/non-selectable; live broker writes remain disabled.
- Scope: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## 2026-10-24 — Phase 3 charge component acceptance matrix

- Added docs/PHASE3_CHARGE_COMPONENT_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md with source/effective-date, calculation-base, rounding/residual, GST/overlap, evidence and promotion gates for brokerage, STT, exchange/IPFT, SEBI, stamp duty and GST.
- Prior documentation head passed Backend workflow #40106273353; exact new matrix head is pending workflow #40106537998.
- No tariff candidates activated; automatic quantity/notional allocation remains disabled; PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker writes remain disabled.


## 2026-10-24 — Lossless broker charge API field normalization

- Added a normalization helper and tests preserving MISSING, NULL, ZERO, VALUE and INVALID states without inferring whether an API amount is combined, aggregate or per-fill.
- Exact-head CI is required for the new code/test commits; prior matrix head passed workflow #40106582037.
- No tariff activation, automatic allocation enablement, PR merge or live broker writes.


## 2026-10-24 — Reviewed broker API mapping gate

- Added an exact-scope, effective-dated mapping registry for broker charge API fields. Only approved mappings matching broker, endpoint, schema version, field path, scope and trade date can be selected; unknown/unapproved/overlapping mappings fail closed.
- Field-state normalizer CI passed in workflow #40106757433 on commit `f0e815c5b788744966bf2bacbfbe9c79dbfdd822`. New mapping code/tests and follow-up documentation still require exact-head CI.
- No live API semantics were approved, no tariff activated, no PR merge, and no live broker writes.


## 2026-10-24 — API mapping CI checkpoint

- Verified successful Backend workflows #40106949357 for the API mapping guard/test commit and #40106989369 for the source-register documentation commit.
- Exact-head CI remains required after subsequent documentation changes. No production Upstox mapping or tariff was approved.


## 2026-10-24 — Controlled charge API value resolution

- Added resolver + regression tests requiring exact approved mappings and preventing aggregate/estimate fields from being consumed as per-fill actuals. Missing/null/invalid values remain unusable; numeric zero is preserved as a separate state.
- Synthetic fixtures do not approve any live Upstox API semantics. Exact-head CI remains pending for these new changes.


## 2026-10-24 — Charge API unusable-value provenance hardening

- Review found that `resolve_charge_api_value` retained the approved mapping's semantic and source fingerprint for usable values, but omitted source URL and SHA-256 provenance when the normalized field was `MISSING`, `NULL`, or `INVALID`. These values were already unusable, but their interpretation path was less auditable.
- Fixed the resolver to return approved mapping provenance for every normalized state while keeping missing/null/invalid values `usable=False`. Numeric zero remains a distinct present value; this change does not promote allocations or approve production Upstox mappings.
- Added regression coverage for missing, null, NaN, negative, boolean, and object values; assertions now require mapping source URL, source SHA-256, and semantic to remain present. Added mapping effective-date and estimate-vs-actual guard cases.
- Implementation commit: `845e9e0dc924f11ae89b96ef73c94c59c2efb4b4`. Test commit / branch head: `1d7e24b0ba8c89062ec1eeddb93d0c4cd22a226f`.
- Exact-head backend CI is running as workflow [#40107754617](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40107754617); do not mark this code/test head green until all workflow gates complete successfully.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## 2026-10-24 — Effective-date test fixture correction

- CI exposed one failing test among 850 total: the future-date case expected rejection while its synthetic mapping used `effective_to=None` (no end date). The resolver behavior was consistent with the fixture.
- Corrected the synthetic approved mapping to an explicit validity window ending `2026-12-31`, so both before-start and after-end cases test the intended boundary.
- Test fix commit: `9cb89301075a8b532ad634f2c9c60590b16deacc`. Awaiting CI for this commit and the final branch head; earlier run #40107829270 failed on the incorrect fixture and must not be treated as green.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Work stays in `tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## 2026-10-24 — Intended-use semantic matrix regression tests

- Corrected effective-date fixture commit `9cb89301075a8b532ad634f2c9c60590b16deacc` passed its backend workflow (#40107967404); progress and handover documentation workflows also passed (#40107977310 and #40107980514). Latest branch documentation head `26daee136ab1e7b3dd9a9d985f986e063bb8f80e` passed workflow #40107984994. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged.
- Added resolver tests ensuring mapping semantics cannot be relabelled across intended use: per-fill actual, aggregate summary, and estimate; included valid semantic/use pairs and rejection of an unknown intended use. Test commit: `53ba96dc3700de75a64b415c095f6a5810efdaf0`.
- New test commit still requires CI. This test-only step does not approve production broker mappings, enable allocation promotion, or enable live broker order submission.
- Next accounting acceptance gap: test concurrent verification/promotion against a shared database with separate sessions, or explicitly document the limitation if the existing test harness cannot reliably exercise it. Keep lock order and rollback protections intact.
- Work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is out of scope.


## 2026-10-24 — Resolver acceptance and CI checkpoint

- Latest previously verified documentation head: `8214430f562f6f425cfc1b9b6a6b3b547832b68a`; backend workflow [#40108183667](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40108183667) succeeded on that head. New resolver test commits `0f05f52cbb7c3afbe1c159fb94837c9776eb9262` and `65e7b56de6b193423106d57101a11d54dcc7894c` add exact broker/endpoint/schema/field/scope matching and non-finite-number rejection cases; these newer commits still require CI.
- The mapping identity test fixtures use immutable dataclass replacement. Intended-use semantics remain explicit; missing/null/invalid states remain unusable and preserve mapping provenance; zero remains distinct.
- Accounting acceptance already covers replay/conflict, ledger reconciliation, lock order, rollback, reviewer authority and a PostgreSQL verification/promotion race. Re-check exact test and workflow status before claiming complete; CI does not establish production tariff correctness or broker-origin authenticity.
- Safety gates unchanged: PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker order submission disabled; automatic quantity/notional allocation disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs unapproved. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` must remain untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Resolver field-identity guard added; CI pending

- Review found a mapping-identity gap: the resolver selected a mapping by `field_path` but normalized the separate `field` argument without checking that it was the mapped field. A caller could otherwise pair the approved `charges.ipft` mapping with a different top-level payload field.
- Added a fail-closed check requiring the normalized payload field to match the terminal field name in the approved mapping path. Added a regression test proving a mismatched payload field is rejected.
- Implementation commit: `77aa77aec37dc535c3e427ca3f88c2ccb5e75ed8`; regression-test commit: `5c5482c7f7fa623707698f64b6a061351e5e5b87`. CI for these commits is pending; do not claim green until the latest branch head is verified.
- Prior backend workflow `40108552948` passed on earlier head `cf5497aec438a3b6c91ae4d67c445cdbacd7b34b`; this does not validate the new field-identity guard.
- Accounting concurrency review remains a separate acceptance item: existing promotion tests assert canonical lock order and rollback/idempotency, but the current test file does not itself demonstrate a genuinely concurrent two-session verification-versus-promotion race. Confirm whether another integration test exercises that race before marking the item complete.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs remain unapproved. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Latest resolver CI verified; PostgreSQL race coverage located

- Latest PR head `ed346e823cbfae8448fae0134c4ff864bfcc60ac` passed Backend workflow [#40109041654](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40109041654). This head includes the resolver payload-field/mapping-path identity guard and its regression test, plus the synchronized docs through this checkpoint.
- Located PostgreSQL-only integration coverage in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`: conflicting fill-set serialization; concurrent source verification and allocation promotion; full live-fill promotion racing ledger verification; and concurrent tariff estimate/variance persistence cases. These tests require `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`; their execution depends on the PostgreSQL CI job actually provisioning and running that suite.
- Therefore the earlier concern that no dedicated verification-versus-promotion race test exists is corrected: a dedicated test is present. Next verify the workflow job log confirms this PostgreSQL test was run rather than skipped, then inspect its assertions for accounting/position side effects.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled; production Upstox mappings/tariffs remain unapproved. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Accounting invariant audit checkpoint

- Reviewed `backend/app/services/live_fill_accounting_service.py` and its unit tests. New accounting writes (live position mutation and execution insert) are committed in one transaction; all exceptions roll back. A post-commit refresh failure is covered by retry-as-exact-replay tests.
- Verified test coverage for exact replay, conflicting fill/evidence payloads, unchanged paper position and portfolio cash, failed flush/commit rollback, charge totals matching six components, and deterministic paise allocation.
- Dedicated PostgreSQL concurrency tests exercise verification-vs-promotion, live-fill-vs-ledger verification, conflicting fill sets, and concurrent tariff snapshot replay/conflict. CI on head `bacbe9dd9dfa35d739bbcea2bfece6185dc391d0` passed workflow [#40109864007](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40109864007). This passing head predates the present audit-note commit(s); recheck CI on the new head.
- Remaining acceptance is not waived: ensure the PostgreSQL-only tests are exercised by required CI with `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`, verify latest branch checks after this documentation change, and continue authoritative tariff/API-field review. Synthetic test fixtures do not approve production tariff semantics.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Production Upstox mappings/tariffs remain unapproved. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Official tariff/API source audit

- Upstox Developer API `GET /v2/trade/profit-loss/charges` is scoped by segment, financial year and optional dates; it returns a `charges_breakdown` summary, not a documented per-fill record. Its published example has `charges.ipft: null`. Do not use this endpoint alone to ground actual per-fill charges; null remains distinct from zero. https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-charges/
- NSE Finance & Accounts circular NSE/FA/73061 dated 27-Feb-2026 is effective 1-Mar-2026: combined member outflow ₹307/crore cash, ₹183/crore equity futures, ₹3,553/crore equity-options premium; IPFT contribution ₹0.01/crore each side. This is scoped exchange schedule evidence, not proof of Upstox's contract-note field mapping. https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf
- Upstox's public charges page lists newer effective-date summary tables alongside older historical tables. Apply effective-dated versioning; don't select stale rates based on page position. STT/CTT values also change from 1-Apr-2026 on the published page. https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/
- No production mapping or tariff is approved. Keep mappings DRAFT; reject aggregate/estimate/null values for actual per-fill evidence; do not separately add IPFT where already included in combined exchange outflow.
- Latest code/test head before this note, `ee1b2a74d2a9f6141b9afbb6e06562b5cf263a9b`, passed Backend workflow #40110597753. This documentation change needs fresh CI verification.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live order submission and automatic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Aggregate endpoint hard guard added; CI pending

- Added a fail-closed resolver guard that blocks Upstox `/v2/trade/profit-loss/charges` from `PER_FILL_ACTUAL` use even if a registry row is incorrectly labelled per-fill. Official docs describe segment/financial-year/date-range aggregate `charges_breakdown`, not a per-fill schema.
- Regression test `test_official_upstox_aggregate_charges_endpoint_cannot_be_promoted_to_per_fill` verifies the endpoint restriction.
- Implementation `cdc07afdd8cc0c8d0b37d7e4aa8cdf1bf6eac651`; test `8ae749017a8ba0016f2c9adeb77eaff41fb5ae70`. Implementation CI is running; test workflow is queued. Await a green result before calling this safeguard verified.
- This does not approve production mappings/tariffs. Null remains distinct from zero; automatic quantity/notional allocation and live order submission remain disabled. PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## 2026-10-24 — Upstox brokerage calculator restricted to estimates; CI pending

- Official Upstox `GET /v2/charges/brokerage` takes proposed instrument, quantity, product, transaction type and price, returning a charge calculation; this is not proof of final booked per-fill charges. https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/
- Resolver now blocks `/v2/charges/brokerage` from `PER_FILL_ACTUAL` and actual `AGGREGATE_SUMMARY` use even if a mapping is misleadingly labelled. Existing guard still blocks `/v2/trade/profit-loss/charges` from per-fill actual use. New regression tests cover both misuse cases.
- Implementation `3486d854dae2451858a858cb627602aca7338969`; tests `6c92101a1890a0f4d761e86ed3db047a269fd10d`. Prior head `6cc8b58f635fcb4f1b1cb3e5997099d074800a28` passed workflow #40111501429. CI for the new commits must be verified.
- Production mappings/tariffs remain unapproved; null is not zero; automatic quantity/notional allocation and live broker order submission remain disabled. PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.

## 2026-10-24 — Upstox SDK/API repository audit

- Added `docs/UPSTOX_SDK_API_REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md` documenting existing API clients, official SDK/Agent Skill evidence, capability gaps, and the proposed isolated SDK compatibility spike.
- Confirmed `backend/requirements.txt` does not declare the official Upstox Python SDK. Existing async REST clients, V3 protobuf/WebSocket streaming, read-only reconciliation, and brokerage response parsing already exist.
- No SDK dependency or application code was changed in this audit. Decision: evaluate SDK support/version/license and async/error-handling fit before adoption; do not duplicate existing clients.
- No live API calls, account access, or orders were made. Estimate/aggregate semantics, DRAFT tariff status, PAPER-only development, live-write restrictions, PR #6 draft/unmerged status, and repository boundary remain unchanged.

## 2026-10-24 — SDK/Agent Skill static compatibility review

- Added `docs/UPSTOX_AGENT_SKILL_SECURITY_REVIEW.md` and expanded the SDK/API audit with official SDK v2.30.0 method/dependency findings and Agent Skill risks.
- Confirmed the generated brokerage SDK method is synchronous by default and existing async REST plus project-owned parser already covers this endpoint. No runtime dependency was added.
- Reviewed Agent Skill helper, validator, live equity-order and GTT examples, config example and MIT licence. No skill code was executed and no live credentials/API calls/orders were used.


## 2026-10-25 — Phase 3 GST/IPFT source cross-check

- Cross-checked current Upstox charges schedule, NSE STT effective-date table, and CBIC stock-broking GST FAQ. Public wording does not establish API `transaction` field semantics, so no mapping/tariff was activated.
- Exact-head CI for prior head `7d4f2918b534ef9b4c3d32e7df22b754b21e6c8f` passed (run [40182196510](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40182196510)); this docs update needs exact-head CI. PAPER mandatory; live writes disabled; PR #6 draft/unmerged.


## 2026-10-25 — Harden known Upstox endpoint restrictions

- Canonicalized broker/endpoint identity for source-level aggregate-only and estimate-only guards. Exact registry mapping matching remains unchanged.
- Added regression cases for broker casing, trailing slash, query strings and absolute URLs. No tariff or field mapping was approved.
- CI must pass on the exact resulting commit before the change is considered verified.

## Phase 3 forward checkpoint — 25 October 2026

- The source-evidence intake vocabulary now supports documented Upstox transaction, clearing, IPFT, other and demat transaction labels through migration `202610250019`. This stores pending source evidence only.
- Live-fill accounting remains fail-closed on anything beyond the six currently reconciled components. A versioned component-set contract must precede any promotion of separately reported IPFT or other additional components.
- NSE combined-vs-split IPFT arithmetic is already covered by regression tests; actual Upstox field semantics and GST component composition still require independent endpoint/schema and contract-note/invoice evidence.
- Exact-head CI is required for the new migration/code/test head. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged, PAPER mandatory, live broker writes disabled, original `Tradepro` untouched.



## Versioned exchange-charge representation contract — 25 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_representation_contract.py` with pinned contract version `exchange-charge-representation-v1`. The validator requires an explicit reviewed representation mode, preserves original source labels, validates normalized component names and paise-precision amounts, and rejects combined transaction charges plus a separate IPFT amount to prevent double counting.
- Added `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_representation_contract.py` covering combined versus split representations, equivalent ₹307.00 exchange-charge base, duplicate IPFT rejection, missing components, unknown/inferred modes, invalid amounts, raw-label retention, and unsupported component labels.
- This contract validates representation only. It deliberately returns `accounting_approved: false`; it does not authenticate a source document, approve a broker API mapping, decide GST taxable composition, allocate aggregate amounts to fills, or enable live accounting. Existing promotion remains fail-closed.
- The implementation and test commits are `3c9ac46ea58257ba4c9c87b1b664eee14c6bd35a` and `be505e3dbc0e93eaa25a012d6a9afba81712e9ab`. Exact-head CI for the latest docs/code head must be checked before this checkpoint is called verified.
- PR #6 remains draft/open/unmerged; PAPER mode remains mandatory; live broker order writes and automatic generic quantity/notional allocation remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Persisted transaction/IPFT representation gate — 25 October 2026

- Added migration `202610250020` and nullable `source_label` / `representation_mode` fields on `broker_charge_source_components`. Existing rows retain their normalized component name as a source-label fallback, but representation mode is deliberately left undeclared rather than inferred.
- Source-component intake now preserves the original label and optional explicit mode. Review of `transaction_charges` / `ipft` rows invokes the versioned representation validator and remains blocked when mode is missing, when combined mode also has a separate IPFT row, when split mode lacks either row, or when sibling rows disagree on mode. Rejected review attempts leave rows pending.
- Added API regression tests for persisted label/mode, combined-plus-separate-IPFT rejection, and missing-mode rejection. Exact-head CI is required before calling this checkpoint verified.
- GST composition, endpoint/schema semantics, authenticated real contract-note evidence, and per-fill allocation approval remain separate gates. No live broker writes or generic quantity/notional allocation were enabled.


## Representation-gate CI correction — 25 October 2026

- The first API regression run exposed two assertion-message mismatches: the validator correctly rejected ambiguous combined-plus-IPFT input and undeclared representation mode, but the tests expected different wording. Updated the tests to assert the validator's actual fail-closed error messages; no safety rule was weakened.
- Follow-up exact-head CI for commit `df344e9c64aeb6ec3f2f01fef01f3c05739d4800` and subsequent documentation synchronization is pending. Do not call the current head green until the full workflow completes.


## Source-label completeness gate — 25 October 2026

- Continued from the current Phase 3 branch head; reused the representation contract already present rather than repeating its implementation.
- Hardened `validate_charge_representation` so each normalized source component must have a retained original source label. Missing labels fail closed before review.
- Added a regression test for incomplete source labels and updated fixtures to retain one label per component.
- Exact-head CI must be checked for the final documentation head. No tariff/API mapping is approved, aggregate/estimate values are not promoted to per-fill actuals, and generic quantity/notional allocation remains disabled.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes disabled; original `Tradepro` out of scope.


## Authoritative IPFT/GST decision — 25 October 2026

This is the carried-forward project decision. Do not restart the IPFT/GST policy discussion or describe the agreed arithmetic as undecided. Keep policy separate from source-evidence and production-approval gates.

### IPFT and NSE exchange-charge representation

Effective 1 March 2026, NSE circular NSE/FA/73061 records combined exchange-charge rates including IPFT: cash equity ₹307.00/crore, equity futures ₹183.00/crore, equity options ₹3,553.00/crore. Equivalent split arithmetic, with IPFT exactly once: cash ₹306.99 + ₹0.01; futures ₹182.99 + ₹0.01; options ₹3,552.99 + ₹0.01.

Combined source: use the combined amount and do not add IPFT. Split source: use transaction charges excluding IPFT plus separately evidenced IPFT once. Never infer representation from a field name. Preserve raw values, original labels, endpoint/schema/version. Missing, conflicting or ambiguous representation fails closed; null is not zero. Representation validation is not source authentication or production mapping approval.

NSE source: circular NSE/FA/73061, 27 February 2026, effective 1 March 2026: https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf

### GST calculation policy

Apply 18% GST to the applicable evidence-backed taxable service-charge base using canonical components once. Working Upstox component policy: delivery = brokerage + transaction charges/IPFT + applicable demat transaction charges; intraday/futures/options = brokerage + transaction charges/IPFT. If transaction charges already include IPFT, count that combined amount once; if split, combine transaction charges excluding IPFT and separately evidenced IPFT once. Apply pure-agent/exclusion treatment only when supported by applicable tax rules and invoice evidence. Use product/segment/effective-date-specific rules, documented rounding and invoice reconciliation.

Reference: https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/

### Status boundary

Settled: combined/split arithmetic, no IPFT double-counting, GST on applicable canonical taxable components once, ambiguous formats fail closed. Remaining production gates: authentic Upstox API/contract-note field semantics, effective-dated mapping and GST composition corroborated against invoices, per-fill equivalence/no-double-count tests, and exact-head CI. Upstox Get Trade Charges is aggregate reconciliation evidence, not per-fill actual evidence. These gates do not reverse the agreed policy.

Safety unchanged: PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes disabled; PR #6 draft/unmerged pending review and user approval. Work only in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, never original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## 2026-10-25 — Phase 3 source-label association hardening

- Required an explicit normalized-component-to-original-source-label mapping in the exchange-charge representation validator.
- Wired the contract-note source-component review API to provide the persisted row-level mapping.
- Added adversarial tests for missing mappings, wrong component keys and inconsistent label ordering.
- Exact-head CI verification pending at implementation HEAD `fb147a3c5580091574bc71c35e7a641cf7386935`; this entry records implementation, not a claim of successful verification.

## 2026-10-25 — Phase 3 missing source-label guard

- Removed fallback that fabricated a raw source label from the normalized component name.
- Missing labels remain null and block review; added API regression coverage.
- Exact-head CI pending for implementation HEAD `34e3d3e865660f96b432968565f2b8ceeb9c9184`.

## 2026-10-25 — Phase 3 source-label guard verified

- Missing source labels remain absent rather than being replaced by normalized component names; review rejects missing labels after authorization/fill validation.
- Implementation SHA `b92d0185f588e24d54510b36659944e77f498a6e` passed [CI #40189481491](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40189481491), 911 passed / 1 warning / 0 failures. Documentation SHA `704d9d5caa8a893195d5213ae38b97c30639de96` passed [CI #40189515861](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40189515861).
- The report synchronization commit requires its own exact-head CI check.



## Phase 3 forward checkpoint — persisted representation-contract version (2026-10-25)

- Audited the actual branch and confirmed the previous source-label authenticity guard is already implemented and CI-verified at `b92d0185f588e24d54510b36659944e77f498a6e`; this task does not repeat that work.
- Added nullable `representation_contract_version` to `BrokerChargeSourceComponent` and migration `202610250021`. Null is retained for legacy/undeclared rows; the migration does not infer a version for historical records.
- The source-component intake API now accepts, stores, and returns the version. Review of transaction/IPFT components requires the supported persisted version and requires sibling transaction/IPFT rows to agree on both mode and version before the existing combined/split validator runs.
- Added API regression assertions for persistence and response round-trip. Implementation commit: `1d327b145fe25d871a763985b5f746e12e107b75`. Exact-head backend workflow [#40190287853](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40190287853) was **in progress when this checkpoint was written**; do not mark the implementation CI-verified until its conclusion is successful. The documentation commit will require its own exact-head CI as well.
- This is an auditability step, not tariff approval, source authenticity proof, GST approval, or authorization to promote more components. Live accounting still requires its existing six-component set; extra components remain fail-closed. Paper mode and live-order safeguards are unchanged; PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.
- Next single implementation gate: define and persist an explicit versioned component-set contract that distinguishes supported canonical accounting components from retained evidence-only components, then add tests proving missing, extra, duplicate, mixed-representation, and legacy-version rows cannot be silently omitted or promoted.


### CI correction history — persisted representation-contract version (2026-10-25)

- Workflow [#40190287853](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40190287853) failed on `1d327b145fe25d871a763985b5f746e12e107b75` due to one existing API regression assertion expecting the previous validation error wording. The underlying fail-closed mode check was still rejecting the request; the test stopped on the message mismatch.
- Corrected the response wording without relaxing validation in commit `db1ee170629fcb853b5c6e46f0d9d8654056bc44`. The failure remains recorded as history and is not counted as a successful verification.
- Workflow [#40190403007](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40190403007) was triggered for documentation HEAD `0abfa9a1ed5dcd553f1b92010ec86b41ccf77a2b`; that SHA predates the wording correction and must not be treated as verification of `db1ee170629fcb853b5c6e46f0d9d8654056bc44`. Exact-head CI for the corrected implementation and current documentation head remains pending.
- Next action: confirm the corrected exact-head workflow succeeds, then add explicit missing-version API regression coverage and continue the versioned component-set contract. No tariff candidates are promoted; live accounting still requires the existing six canonical components.


## Phase 3 forward checkpoint — versioned canonical component set (2026-10-25)

- Added `broker_charge_component_set_contract.py` with explicit `live-fill-accounting-component-set-v1` and the exact six canonical accounting components: brokerage, STT, exchange charges, SEBI charges, stamp duty, and GST.
- Added nullable `component_set_version` to source-component records via migration `202610250022`. No version is backfilled for legacy records. Canonical components receive the current set version only during independent review; evidence-only components remain unversioned and cannot be silently counted as canonical.
- Live-fill promotion now checks the full non-rejected source-component set before accounting: missing/extra/duplicate components, null/unsupported versions, and unreviewed rows fail closed. Additional evidence labels are preserved but block promotion until an explicit reviewed mapping exists. The prior six-allocation check remains in place.
- Added contract tests for exact set, missing/extra/duplicate components, legacy version and unreviewed rows. Updated the real PostgreSQL race fixture to declare the set version explicitly.
- Implementation/test checkpoint: `f61cedd25f5982846774db3028fb646d2e108e07`. Exact-head CI [#40191140007](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40191140007) passed: **917 passed, 1 warning, 0 failures**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL migration round-trips through migration `202610250022`, and synthetic restore drill passed. Synthetic restore does not prove actual Oracle Cloud recovery.
- Prior failed CI remains documented: run [#40190926423](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40190926423) exposed a missing set-version value in the PostgreSQL concurrency fixture; the fixture was corrected in the verified commit above. It is not counted as a successful run.
- This does not yet map raw `transaction_charges` + `ipft` source rows to canonical `exchange_charges`, approve tariffs/GST, or enable promotion of evidence-only rows. Live broker writes remain disabled; PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.
- Next single implementation gate: define and test an explicit, versioned source-to-canonical mapping for combined versus split transaction/IPFT evidence, preserving both raw source rows while producing one canonical exchange-charge amount only when the representation is explicitly reviewed. Other unsupported source components must continue to block promotion.


## Phase 3 forward checkpoint — combined/split source canonicalization contract (2026-10-25)

- Added `broker_charge_source_canonicalization.py` and focused tests. The pure contract maps explicit COMBINED transaction/IPFT source representation to one canonical `exchange_charges` amount, or sums SPLIT transaction charges plus separately evidenced IPFT exactly once. It retains source-row associations in its result and rejects ambiguous/mixed versions, double mapping, duplicate/missing labels, invalid amounts, and unsupported clearing/demat/other components.
- Exact-head CI [#40191589060](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40191589060) passed on implementation/test commit `44c12acd133924711cd68c27f315d9298c6acfde`: **930 passed, 1 warning, 0 failures**. Broker-write boundary guard and synthetic restore drill passed. Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle recovery.
- Important boundary: this is a tested pure canonicalization contract, **not yet wired into the API review flow or durable allocation ledger**. It does not authenticate source notes, approve tariffs/GST, allocate canonical totals to fills, or enable live accounting. Do not count the end-to-end mapping gate as complete.
- Current branch/PR safety remains unchanged: work only in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; PAPER mode mandatory; live broker writes disabled; original `Tradepro` untouched.
- Next single implementation gate: wire this canonicalization contract into reviewed source-component validation and per-fill allocation persistence so raw source rows remain immutable, canonical exchange charges reconcile exactly, and promotion cannot omit or double-count source components.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — verified source-component canonicalization adapter (25 October 2026)

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_verified_component_canonicalization.py` and focused tests in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_verified_component_canonicalization.py`.
- The adapter accepts only persisted `VERIFIED` rows tied to the expected evidence ID and matching SHA-256, with INR currency, reviewer identity/timestamp, unique row IDs, and source locators. It delegates the six-component and combined/split transaction/IPFT rules to the existing canonicalization contract and returns source-record provenance.
- Output explicitly remains `accounting_approved=false`. This is a validation adapter, not yet the transaction-owning persistence/promotion integration. It does not prove broker-origin authenticity, establish GST/tariff applicability, or enable automatic allocation.
- Implementation commit: `d3a2fc076a4309f23edbb14b0a47ba41fec0b557`; regression-test commit: `c8e3748f12c5674b1b77e76ff8fcf9b8f3dc68a6`. Backend workflow [#40192336466](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40192336466) passed on code/test commit `c8e3748f12c5674b1b77e76ff8fcf9b8f3dc68a6`; Backend pytest and the synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill succeeded. Subsequent commits only synchronize documentation; no application code changed after the tested code/test head. No workflow run is associated with the latest docs-only head, so report the code/test head as green but do not claim a separately verified exact-head CI run for the latest docs commit.
- Next implementation gate: integrate this adapter into the existing locked source-component verification/allocation-promotion path; persist canonical totals and source-row associations atomically, and test duplicate/replay/conflict, rollback, partial fill sets, and PostgreSQL concurrency before enabling any accounting promotion.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled; production tariff/GST/IPFT interpretations remain unapproved.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — canonical source-to-allocation planning (25 October 2026)

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_canonical_allocation_plan.py` and `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_canonical_allocation_plan.py`. The planning boundary composes reviewed-source canonicalization with deterministic paise allocation, returning per-fill amounts and source-row provenance without database writes or accounting approval.
- Only `EXPLICIT_REVIEWED` weights are enabled pending approved component-specific tariff rules. Contributing source rows must share the canonical fill manifest/hash, explicit weights, basis and allocation-method version. Split transaction/IPFT values are combined once into canonical exchange charges before allocation.
- Tightened the verified-source adapter to reject same-user extraction and review; added regression coverage.
- Commits: planner `a3a51ce8257b2300ead83158c423772f420545f8`; planner tests `1dffc90897e524a3c4065740daf3b31f2aaabf03`; independent-reviewer guard `f17e75ab4cc8eef448dd4743b942a13b0af8d2d0`; guard test `18d69d5fee2a4a2668cdf32a8ad0661aba8adbe3`.
- Backend workflow `40193811936` was in progress at the latest check. Do not mark the newest code/test head green until CI completes and covers the latest test commit. Database persistence/promotion integration remains the next gate.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion disabled; GST/tariff/IPFT interpretations unapproved.


## CI follow-up — canonical allocation planner (25 October 2026)

- Backend workflow [#40193836363](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40193836363) passed on independent-reviewer test commit `18d69d5fee2a4a2668cdf32a8ad0661aba8adbe3`. Backend pytest, SQLite migration cycle, PostgreSQL 16 migration cycle, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill all succeeded.
- A newer docs-only checkpoint commit triggered Backend workflow [#40193954195](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40193954195), still in progress at last check. Code/test head is green; latest documentation head is not yet confirmed green.
- Next: wait for exact latest-head CI, then connect planning output to the locked persistence/reconciliation service using source-row provenance and canonical component identity. Do not promote accounting until transaction and replay/concurrency tests pass.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — verified canonical allocation persistence boundary (25 October 2026)

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_verified_allocation_persistence_service.py`. It locks reviewed evidence and source rows, requires the approved `live-fill-accounting-component-set-v1` of six independently reviewed direct-mapped components, builds the verified canonical plan, and delegates to the existing idempotent allocation persistence service. It leaves allocations `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`, never commits, and requires caller-owned outer transaction.
- Added persistence-boundary tests in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py` for successful direct-component allocation and rejection of an unapproved component-set version.
- Split transaction/IPFT planning is supported, but persistence deliberately rejects it until a durable canonical-component ledger links multiple raw source rows to one canonical exchange-charge component.
- Implementation commit `d92219dcae765c2b8a305a825ae10c4596315f6a`; tests commit `9a837155260d0f2fef4cd9fd9dee458b2db13f90`. Exact-head Backend workflow [#40194167945](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40194167945) was in progress at last check; do not mark the new boundary green until it completes.
- Next: inspect exact-head CI; if green, implement durable canonical-component/source-row associations for combined/split transaction/IPFT, then add rollback, replay/conflict and PostgreSQL concurrency tests.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion disabled; tariff/GST/IPFT interpretations unapproved.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — durable canonical source snapshots (25 October 2026)

- Added `BrokerChargeCanonicalComponent` model, migration `202610250023_canonical_charge_components.py`, model registration, and `broker_charge_canonical_component_snapshot_service.py`.
- The materializer locks reviewed evidence and source rows, verifies stored contract-note bytes against SHA-256/size, requires independent source review and the approved component-set version, canonicalizes reviewed rows, and creates six versioned canonical snapshots in `PENDING_REVIEW`. It preserves exact raw source row IDs, source fingerprint, mapping/representation version, amounts, fill manifest/weights, and allocation policy. Identical snapshots replay idempotently; changes to reviewed allocation metadata create a new revision.
- Tests cover direct snapshots, split transaction/IPFT mapping to one exchange-charge snapshot, idempotent replay, unverified rows, tampered source documents, and revisioning after allocation-metadata changes.
- Latest code/test commit: `af14297ee904b7b021fc149e3ac3adf2cb0743f1`. Exact-head Backend workflow [#40194614746](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40194614746) was in progress at last check; do not call the new snapshot model/migration green until it completes.
- Next: verify migration/test CI, then add a distinct reviewer workflow for canonical snapshots and adapt allocation reconciliation to reference canonical snapshot IDs/source fingerprints rather than assuming one raw source row equals one canonical component.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion disabled; production tariff/GST/IPFT interpretations unapproved.


## Phase 3 CI correction — canonical snapshot test (25 October 2026)

- Backend workflow [#40194614746](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40194614746) reported 1 failure and 951 passes. The failure was test-only: the split transaction/IPFT snapshot test passed string UUIDs to a SQLAlchemy UUID column query. Fixed the test to convert persisted source-row IDs to `UUID` objects in commit `0a7437b9b413f86832cc029b983751c25007e21a`.
- The prior run is not green overall. Verification of the correction is pending a new Backend CI result; do not report canonical snapshot work as green yet.
- The migration/model and snapshot materializer remain on the Phase 3 branch only. No live-order or accounting-promotion behavior was enabled.


## CI follow-up — canonical snapshot UUID test correction (25 October 2026)

- Corrected the split transaction/IPFT test to pass UUID objects to SQLAlchemy. Exact code/test commit `0a7437b9b413f86832cc029b983751c25007e21a` passed Backend workflow [#40194933563](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40194933563): pytest, broker-write boundary, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore all succeeded.
- Documentation-only head `408af47077c18ecbe22418bad8cae109cf8741ef` triggered Backend workflow [#40195063845](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40195063845), which was in progress at the last check. Do not claim that later documentation head green until it completes.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — independent canonical snapshot review (25 October 2026)

- Added `broker_charge_canonical_component_review_service.py` to review canonical snapshots separately from raw source-row review. It rechecks stored contract-note bytes, source-row IDs, current canonical mapping/amount, mapping and representation versions, and source fingerprint under locks. Only an active admin distinct from the snapshot creator, source reviewer, and extractors can mark a snapshot `VERIFIED` or `REJECTED`; decisions are immutable and exact replay is idempotent.
- Added tests for split transaction/IPFT review, independent reviewer enforcement, idempotent review replay, and rejection when a source locator changes after snapshot creation.
- New code/test commit `9bb7ebaeeaee62753ba7580cf1dc94400df5aea4`; Backend workflow [#40195392377](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40195392377) was queued at the latest check. Do not mark the new reviewer workflow green until CI completes.
- Next: verify this CI result, then extend allocation persistence/reconciliation to bind allocations to the verified canonical snapshot ID and source fingerprint, including combined/split transaction/IPFT.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — allocations linked to verified canonical snapshots (25 October 2026)

- Added nullable `BrokerChargeAllocation.canonical_component_id` plus migration `202610250024_link_allocations_to_canonical_components.py`. Historical rows remain NULL; no inferred backfill.
- Added `broker_charge_canonical_allocation_persistence_service.py`. It requires a `VERIFIED` canonical snapshot, re-runs independent snapshot integrity/reviewer validation, delegates to the evidence-locked idempotent allocation writer, and persists the canonical snapshot foreign key on every allocation. It never commits or marks allocations reconciled. Split transaction/IPFT can now be planned, snapshotted, independently reviewed, and persisted against one canonical exchange-charge identity.
- Added integration coverage for split transaction/IPFT snapshot review and allocation persistence, exact ₹307.00 reconciliation, snapshot foreign-key linkage, pending-only status, and idempotent replay. Corrected canonical snapshot code/test commit `0a7437b9b413f86832cc029b983751c25007e21a` passed workflow [#40194933563](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40194933563); independent snapshot review passed [#40195392377](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40195392377).
- Latest persistence test commit `be761f4064136662ea1e5c18fef0c2b40237a387`; Backend workflow [#40195695138](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40195695138) was in progress at last check. Do not call the new migration/persistence path green until it completes.
- Next: verify exact-head CI; then implement canonical-snapshot allocation verification and promotion so live-fill accounting validates canonical snapshot IDs and fingerprints instead of assuming one raw source row per canonical component.
- Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Phase 3 — normalized source-to-canonical charge links (25 October 2026)

- Added `BrokerChargeCanonicalSourceLink` and migration `202610250025_normalize_canonical_source_links.py`. The database stores a foreign-key row per canonical snapshot/source-row relationship, with uniqueness constraints for each pair and source order. Existing links are backfilled only from the snapshot's persisted ordered source-ID manifest; no mapping is inferred from labels or amounts.
- Snapshot creation persists normalized links and checks them on idempotent replay. Independent review requires normalized links, order and manifest to agree; missing or altered membership fails closed. This explicitly represents split transaction + IPFT as two raw rows belonging to one canonical exchange-charge snapshot.
- Previous branch head `4dbaf27fae124d11935c271f2f4cdec44015dbaa` passed Backend workflow [#40196030459](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40196030459). New normalized-link change `d1153a0f0751339f3ca82fc062701db0141d4749` awaits fresh CI verification.
- Next: verify migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade on SQLite and PostgreSQL 16, then require normalized source membership and canonical snapshot fingerprint in promotion/reconciliation.
- Safety: only the Improved repository; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.


## Phase 3 — normalized source links and canonical reconciliation gate (25 October 2026)

- Normalized source-link migration passed Backend workflow [#40196529023](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40196529023), including pytest, broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade and synthetic restore drill.
- Added `broker_charge_canonical_allocation_reconciliation_service.py`: verifies canonical snapshot approval and fingerprint, normalized source-row links, exact reviewed fill manifest, deterministic paise amounts, INR/method/basis, totals and state; atomic promotion/replay uses a durable snapshot/fingerprint/fill-set reference and never commits the caller's transaction.
- Added split transaction/IPFT normalized-link, successful promotion/replay and tamper-blocking tests. Commit `621ce7cd289057a419be5eeff0262e158b18c001` Backend workflow [#40196784435](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40196784435) was in progress at checkpoint; latest reconciliation code is not marked green until completed.
- Next: fix any exact-head CI failures, then add conflict/rollback and PostgreSQL concurrency coverage before closing this Phase 3 gate.
- Safety: Improved repository only; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes remain blocked.


## CI result update — canonical reconciliation gate (25 October 2026)

- Backend workflow [#40196784435](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40196784435) completed successfully for code/test commit `621ce7cd289057a419be5eeff0262e158b18c001`. Pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore all passed.
- This verifies the normalized source-link schema and canonical allocation reconciliation tests at that code/test head. Later docs-only commits still need exact-head CI verification if a workflow is triggered.
- Next: explicit rollback/conflicting-set and PostgreSQL concurrent-promotion coverage, followed by fresh exact-head CI.

## AUTHORITATIVE CURRENT STATE — supersedes older next-step notes (25 October 2026)

Historical entries remain historical records; they must not override this current checkpoint.

- Repository: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. Branch: `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. PR #6 is open, draft, and unmerged. Never work in original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- Latest verified implementation/test head: `3d8c4e1425825e6b996500ce9f24630d6352ff5e`.
- Exact-head Backend workflow [#40200645237](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40200645237) completed successfully. Pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore all passed.
- Latest test `test_canonical_reconciliation_rejects_incomplete_allocation_fill_set` removes one row from a two-fill canonical set and confirms promotion fails closed, leaving the remaining row pending without a reconciliation reference.
- Completed; do not repeat: normalized canonical/source links, reviewed immutable snapshots, split transaction + IPFT provenance, durable per-fill allocations, canonical ledger verification, deterministic paise allocation, promotion/replay, tampered-allocation rejection, existing rollback assertions, and incomplete-fill-set rejection.
- **Next single implementation step:** inspect existing coverage and add PostgreSQL concurrent-promotion tests proving concurrent attempts cannot create partial/mixed states or inconsistent durable references. Add conflicting-set/rollback tests only where a real gap remains. Then run the full backend CI gate.
- CI protocol: on failure, diagnose/fix/rerun. On pass, update all 18 maintained checkpoint documents with exact SHA/run/result and next step, commit checkpoint, then verify CI on the checkpoint commit itself. Before resuming, refresh the live PR head and read docs from that exact SHA.
- GST/IPFT production tariff/account-specific acceptance is a separate evidence gate and does not block synthetic engineering tests. Unapproved tariff candidates remain DRAFT.
- Safety: PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes disabled; PR #6 stays draft/unmerged absent explicit authorization; original `Tradepro` untouched.



## Verified checkpoint — 2026-10-25
- Implementation commit `07df26a88d5eb9cbebc76a5654e10e00e38de171` passed Backend CI run #40204137793 on the exact commit: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40204137793
- Root cause fixed: PostgreSQL rejected complete durable reconciliation references because the column was limited to 200 characters. Model and migration `202610250026_widen_charge_reconciliation_reference.py` now support 320 characters; downgrade refuses truncation.
- PostgreSQL concurrent-promotion coverage is implemented and passed in the run above. Documentation checkpoint commit still requires exact-head CI verification.
- Next: once checkpoint CI passes, audit for any demonstrated conflicting-set/rollback test gap and add only missing coverage.
- Protocol: every CI failure → diagnose/fix/rerun; every CI pass → update all 18 maintained checkpoint documents, commit exact SHA/run/results/next step, then verify CI on the checkpoint commit.
- Safeguards: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6 draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes disabled. GST/IPFT production tariff acceptance is a separate gate.


## Authoritative checkpoint — 26 October 2026 (documentation CI verified)

- Repository: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; branch: `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`.
- Latest implementation commit: `ac7d27f2c9922925483b5b906c484c0d5a4e3f53`; exact-head Backend CI [#40287765745 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40287765745).
- Documentation synchronization commit: `f90573d653c7103bf9cfdb1f867da97b176d3240`; its exact-head Backend CI [#40289107666 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40289107666). Backend tests, broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore/evidence retention passed. Synthetic restore is not proof of actual Oracle Cloud recovery.
- The approved public Upstox STT/exchange rules are estimate-only. Account-specific actual charges, GST taxable-base composition, stamp duty, SEBI/DP/demat/other charges, unsupported exchange/segment mappings, and per-fill actual evidence remain unapproved. Candidate tariff entries remain DRAFT unless separately allowlisted and reviewed.
- Phase 3 remains in progress. Next gates: independently reviewed tariff applicability; component-specific per-fill allocation rules; invoice/source-backed GST/IPFT and product/segment evidence; final adversarial, migration and recovery review; exact-head acceptance sign-off. Do not repeat canonical live-fill integration.
- Safety: PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes, automatic live-fill promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. PR #6 stays open/draft/unmerged without explicit user approval. Only `tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.
- This documentation commit’s CI is green. Continue only from this checkpoint and verify CI for every subsequent implementation/checkpoint commit. Historical entries below or above this section do not supersede this checkpoint.


## GST/IPFT checkpoint — 26 October 2026

- Regression test `test_gst_arithmetic_is_invariant_for_combined_vs_split_ipft_representation` verifies equivalent synthetic representations produce ₹307.00 base and ₹55.26 GST at 18%; arithmetic coverage only, not approval of real taxable-component mapping. Test commit `8b4ae0b431d6aa03f1a8ae347a0b5fa7bda44c4f` passed exact-head Backend CI [run 40296066304](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40296066304).
- Official references: NSE circular `NSE/FA/73061` (27 Feb 2026; effective 1 Mar 2026) for combined transaction/IPFT outflows https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf; Upstox GST schedule https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/; CBIC stock-broking FAQ and valuation Rule 33 https://cbic-gst.gov.in/sectoral-faq.html and https://cbic-gst.gov.in/valuation-rules.html.
- Production GST mapping remains blocked pending product/segment-specific review and reliable invoice/contract-note reconciliation. Never apply GST to trade notional/all charges indiscriminately or count separate IPFT twice; STT/stamp duty exclusion requires pure-agent conditions. Candidate tariffs remain DRAFT.
- Next gate: component-level GST acceptance cases across equity delivery, intraday and F&O, then exact-head CI and maintained-doc synchronization. PAPER mandatory, live broker order writes disabled, PR #6 draft/unmerged, original `Tradepro` untouched.


## Canonical latest Phase 3 checkpoint — 26 October 2026

- **Repository:** `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. **Verified code/evidence head:** `d287da70ce184c904c6f9ede9e4a0edca5839f8f` (commit: “docs: reconcile public Upstox contract note GST examples”).
- **Exact-head CI:** PASS — [GitHub Actions run #40304398632](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40304398632), commit `d287da70ce184c904c6f9ede9e4a0edca5839f8f`; **1,004 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and restore-evidence retention also passed. This is CI evidence, not proof of a real Oracle recovery or broker-origin authenticity.
- **GST/IPFT research:** Three public third-party historical Upstox note copies were reconciled: 11-Feb-2025 base ₹2.97 / IGST ₹0.53; 21-May-2024 base ₹77.56 / IGST ₹13.96 (IPFT ₹0.11 listed outside that note's printed base); 12-Mar-2025 base ₹2.75 / IGST ₹0.50. Printed-base compositions differ historically. The current official Upstox schedule supports the **estimate-only** base of brokerage + transaction charges + demat where applicable + IPFT, with IPFT represented exactly once because it is combined with transaction charges. Do not add SEBI to this current estimate base without current applicable billing evidence; never calculate GST on trade notional or infer zero from missing/null fields.
- **Tax/accounting approval:** all four GST component candidates remain `DRAFT`. Historical public copies do not prove current actual per-fill billing across products/accounts. Actual-charge promotion stays gated; estimate logic and actual invoice reconciliation are distinct. Follow effective dates and preserve raw API/source evidence.
- **Next action when resuming:** continue Phase 3 from this exact commit and checkpoint. Next gate is component-specific GST acceptance cases for equity delivery, intraday, futures and options, then implementation review and exact-head CI; do not restart from earlier saved checkpoints.
- **Safety / PR:** PAPER mode mandatory; live broker `place_order`/`modify_order`/`cancel_order` and automatic live-fill promotion remain disabled. PR #6 remains open, draft and unmerged. Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is not the work target and must remain untouched.
- This checkpoint supersedes older statements in this document about CI being in progress or requiring verification for the pre-`d287da7` head. Historical notes remain history; this is the canonical resume point.

## Canonical resume checkpoint — 26 October 2026 (latest branch head verified)

- **Target:** `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. **PR #6:** open, draft, unmerged. Never modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- **Latest branch head before this documentation synchronization:** `5c929ff933d627dd81d5c32ec863843c2ef0f19b`. Exact-head Backend CI **PASS**, run [#40315135121](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40315135121): **1,004 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore and evidence retention passed; synthetic restore is not proof of real Oracle recovery.
- **GST/IPFT finding:** current official Upstox guidance supports an 18% public-schedule estimate base of brokerage + combined transaction/IPFT charges + delivery demat where applicable. Count combined transaction/IPFT once. CBIC FAQ Q77 makes exclusion of STT/stamp duty/other recoveries conditional on Rule 33 pure-agent conditions. Three public historical third-party notes show differing bases (11-Feb-2025 ₹2.97/IGST ₹0.53; 21-May-2024 ₹77.56/IGST ₹13.96 with IPFT outside that printed base; 12-Mar-2025 ₹2.75/IGST ₹0.50); they are not authenticated current evidence.
- **Decision:** all four product GST component candidates remain `DRAFT`; actual per-fill GST promotion is blocked pending reviewed current source/invoice mapping. Never tax trade notional, infer zero from missing/null fields, or double-count IPFT. Aggregate charges API data is not per-fill evidence; the brokerage calculator is estimate-only.
- **Next gate:** continue Phase 3 product/segment-specific GST component acceptance and evidence reconciliation. Do not repeat canonical live-fill integration or restart from older checkpoints. Defer AI/open-source adaptations, including Algory.app, until Phase 3 acceptance.
- **Safety:** PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes and automatic live-fill promotion/scheduling remain disabled. Do not merge PR #6 without explicit user approval. This documentation-sync commit must pass exact-head CI.

## Canonical checkpoint update — 26 October 2026, after cross-repository GST/IPFT audit

- Validated parent commit: `0e15bba3bfa425296f4104c96be6d10e3b42bf40`; Backend tests PASS on exact SHA, run [#40329710846](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40329710846). This documentation-only sync needs its own exact-head CI pass before it is the next validated checkpoint.
- Target repo/branch: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation` only. Never edit original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- GST/IPFT: all four product component candidates remain `DRAFT`. OpenAlgo is architecture inspiration only; the inspected India preset is not an Upstox tax authority. Shoonya's hard-coded example is unverified; NautilusTrader applies to fee-model mechanics, not Indian tax rules.
- Discrepancy: Upstox's documented brokerage API example GST arithmetic does not align with current public tariff wording. This flags a docs-example discrepancy, not proof of live API miscalculation.
- Evidence gate: obtain current ordinary-trade Upstox contract notes/tax invoices or written broker clarification for delivery, intraday, futures and options. Reconcile taxable value against printed components and effective date. Historical rights-entitlement notes and estimate/aggregate APIs do not satisfy this gate.
- Invariants: count combined transaction/IPFT once; never add legacy IPFT on top of combined tariff; never tax trade notional; missing/null is unknown, not zero; do not treat aggregate charges or estimates as actual per-fill GST evidence.
- Next: continue Phase 3 evidence reconciliation and targeted tests only where supported by evidence. Do not repeat canonical live-fill integration. Defer AI/open-source integration including Algory.app until Phase 3 acceptance.
- Safety: PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes and automatic live-fill promotion/scheduling disabled; PR #6 stays draft/unmerged absent explicit user approval.


## GST/IPFT reconciliation checkpoint — 26 October 2026

- Official Upstox schedule https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/ states GST 18% on brokerage + transaction charges + IPFT, including DP/demat for equity delivery. From 1-Mar-2026, published NSE combined transaction/IPFT totals are cash ₹307/crore, equity futures ₹183/crore and equity options ₹3,553/crore on premium. Count combined rates once. NSE circular: https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf.
- The official Upstox Brokerage Details API example https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/ shows transaction ₹5.68, IPFT ₹0.17, GST ₹1.02; that GST matches 18% of ₹5.68 alone, not ₹5.85 (about ₹1.05). This remains an example/documentation conflict, not proof of a live defect.
- The Trades Charges API https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-charges/ provides aggregate segment/date-range charges and may return IPFT null. Null is unknown, not zero; aggregate totals are not per-fill evidence.
- Historical public contract-note copies dated 2024/2025 are third-party and pre-current-tariff; differing printed taxable bases mean they cannot settle current actual-charge treatment. Use for layout/schema only.
- Estimate-only rule may follow current tariff with product/exchange/effective-date handling and combined transaction/IPFT counted once. Actual per-fill GST candidates for delivery, intraday, futures, options remain DRAFT pending current public invoice evidence or written Upstox clarification. No production actual-charge GST logic promoted.
- Previous exact-head CI passed on commit 996b126ff678b97441f0214ea817451ee1592203: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40341429226. Tests, broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migrations, synthetic restore and evidence retention passed; the next documentation commit needs its own exact-head CI.
- Only tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved is in scope; original Tradepro untouched. PAPER mandatory; live order writes and automatic live-fill promotion/scheduling disabled; PR #6 draft/unmerged; no personal contract note requested; AI/Algory deferred until Phase 3 acceptance.


## GST estimate implementation update — 26 October 2026

- Added backend/app/services/upstox_public_gst_estimate.py and backend/tests/test_upstox_public_gst_estimate.py: explicit public-schedule estimate-only GST path, 18%, supported scope from 1-Mar-2026, provenance fingerprint and PUBLIC_SCHEDULE_ESTIMATE_ONLY label. This does not approve actual GST component sets or promote charges.
- Component contract: delivery requires brokerage + exchange_charges + explicit demat_charges; other supported products require brokerage + exchange_charges. For NSE from 1-Mar-2026, exchange_charges is the combined transaction/IPFT total once; separate ipft key is rejected. BSE options use applicable BSE schedule and must not inherit an NSE IPFT assumption.
- Open discrepancy: Upstox Brokerage Details API example shows transaction ₹5.68, IPFT ₹0.17, GST ₹1.02; 18% of ₹5.85 is approximately ₹1.05. The helper follows public tariff wording for estimates only. Actual per-fill GST candidates remain DRAFT pending current public invoice evidence or written Upstox clarification.
- Acceptance matrix: GST_IPFT_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md. Code/test head 221493eb17729533cfaf855e2ce52532ef0903ac; CI run #40342805295 was pending at note time. The next documentation commit needs its own exact-head CI.
- Safety unchanged: Tradepro Improved only, original Tradepro untouched, PAPER mandatory, live broker writes and automatic live-fill promotion/scheduling disabled, PR #6 draft/unmerged, no personal contract note requested, AI/Algory deferred.


## Authoritative GST decision — 26 October 2026

**Decision: implement the current official Upstox public-schedule GST base for estimates now; do not let the inconsistent API documentation sample block it.** Upstox's pricing page explicitly states GST at 18% on brokerage + transaction charges + IPFT, with demat charges additionally included for equity delivery. From 1-Mar-2026, NSE Circular NSE/FA/73061 defines combined transaction/IPFT outflows (cash ₹307/crore, futures ₹183/crore, options ₹3,553/crore premium); represent that as one exchange_charges component and never add IPFT twice. The supported estimate path sums brokerage + combined exchange_charges, and adds explicit demat_charges for delivery. STT, stamp duty and SEBI are not added to this published GST base.

The Brokerage Details API example showing transaction ₹5.68, IPFT ₹0.17 and GST ₹1.02 is internally inconsistent with that page: 18% × ₹5.68 = ₹1.0224 → ₹1.02; 18% × (₹5.68 + ₹0.17) = ₹1.053 → ₹1.05. Treat this as a documentation-example discrepancy, not evidence that current production billing is wrong. Public schedule takes precedence for estimates; the API example does not override it. Trades Charges API is aggregate and its ipft:null is unknown, not zero.

This resolves the public-schedule estimate rule. It does not certify account-specific invoice totals or per-fill actual GST. Keep actual accounting/promotion evidence-gated until invoice/source evidence or written broker clarification is available. A personal contract note from the user is not required. Official sources: https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/ ; https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/ ; https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-charges/ ; https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf ; https://cbic-gst.gov.in/sectoral-faq.html


## Latest GST/IPFT implementation checkpoint — 26 October 2026

- Implementation + synchronized GST decision commit b75a97f6cd0043c185375cc253b84a1e6d6bfea1 passed exact-head Backend CI [#40345937942](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40345937942): 1,012 passed, 1 warning in 62.33s. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore and evidence retention passed.
- Estimate decision: use 18% on brokerage + combined transaction/IPFT exchange charges; add explicit demat charges for equity delivery. Count IPFT once. Exclude STT, stamp duty and SEBI from the published estimate base. API example GST mismatch is a docs-example inconsistency and does not override the current Upstox schedule.
- Actual invoice/per-fill GST acceptance remains separate and evidence-gated; actual component-set candidates stay DRAFT. Do not request a personal contract note. Safety: PAPER mandatory, live order writes/promotion/scheduling disabled, PR #6 draft/unmerged, original Tradepro untouched.


## Cross-broker GST implementation update — 26 October 2026

New official-source comparison confirms the taxable GST component set must not be copied from one broker to another:
- Zerodha states GST on brokerage + SEBI charges + transaction charges: https://zerodha.com/charges/
- Dhan states GST on brokerage + transaction charges + SEBI turnover + IPFT/other tax: https://dhan.co/pricing/
- FYERS states GST on brokerage + exchange transaction + clearing + SEBI turnover + NSE IPFT: https://fyers.in/charges-list
- Upstox publishes brokerage + transaction charges + IPFT, with demat charges additionally for equity delivery: https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/
- Angel One lists transaction charges and IPFT as separate rows; its published table alone does not settle whether a displayed exchange rate is combined for every effective period: https://www.angelone.in/exchange-transaction-charges
- NSE circular NSE/FA/73061 effective 2026-03-01 specifies total outflow as transaction + IPFT: cash ₹306.99 + ₹0.01 per crore, futures ₹182.99 + ₹0.01, options ₹3,552 + ₹0.01. Never add old IPFT rates on top of a combined total: https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/circulars/FA73061.pdf
- CBIC stock-broking FAQ says STT/stamp-duty/other tax recoveries are outside GST value only when Rule 33 pure-agent conditions are met; otherwise section 15/Rule 27 valuation applies: https://cbic-gst.gov.in/sectoral-faq.html

Code now includes a generic public-schedule estimate function for source-backed DRAFT/REVIEWED policies. It preserves broker/scope/date/source provenance, requires an exact component set, uses Decimal and paise rounding, and cannot approve a policy or promote actual accounting. Added tests use differing broker component sets as fixtures only; they are not a production-approved tariff registry. Actual invoice reconciliation, policy review, DP/demat persistence and exact-head CI remain separate gates. PAPER-only; live writes disabled; PR #6 and #7 remain Draft/unmerged; original Tradepro repository remains out of scope.


## Session checkpoint sync — 26 October 2026

- Verified exact-head Backend CI run [#40368554399 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40368554399) on code head `9d3f255480da9a71980a9d3819fbb69a34835753`; Backend pytest job completed successfully.
- GST public-schedule estimate helper and tests are present at this head. This is estimate-only; it does not approve actual accounting or promote estimated amounts as actual charges.
- Statutory direction from CBIC: use CGST Act section 15 and CGST Rules Rule 33/Rule 27 with the CBIC stock-broking FAQ. Pure-agent exclusion is conditional on evidence; do not automatically include/exclude every STT, stamp, transaction, IPFT, SEBI or demat line. IGST Act section 12(12) provides the stock-broking place-of-supply rule; state comparison determines IGST vs CGST+SGST. Sources: https://cbic-gst.gov.in/sectoral-faq.html ; https://cbic-gst.gov.in/valuation-rules.html ; https://cbic-gst.gov.in/central-excise-rules.html
- Next session: implement a standalone statutory GST valuation engine and focused tests (Section 15 inclusion, documented Rule 33 evidence, state-based tax split, Decimal/paise rounding, fail-closed missing facts). That engine is **not yet implemented**, so GST/IPFT acceptance is not complete. IPFT combined/separate representation and DP/demat persistence/reconciliation remain separate gates.
- No personal contract note is available or required to continue implementation. Public sources support research but do not prove actual per-fill accounting acceptance.
- Safety: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6 and #7 remain Draft/unmerged; PAPER-only; live order writes disabled; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` out of scope.


## Phase 3 CI synchronization — 26 October 2026 (GST/IPFT resolver)

- Latest verified code head: `13e201661d26b04c9bf75bb7e3aaf567ad1e69c4`; exact-head Backend CI [#40378072884 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40378072884): **1,056 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary, SQLite migration round-trip, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill and retained restore evidence passed.
- Added scope/effective-date-selected GST policy resolution for `COMBINED`, `SEPARATE`, and `NOT_APPLICABLE` IPFT representation. It rejects double representation, wrong-exchange reuse, missing/extra components, and unapproved or out-of-window policies. This is estimate-policy plumbing, not actual invoice reconciliation or tariff approval.
- Next Phase 3 gate: persist optional DP/demat charges safely, migrate canonical accounting/persistence and total-charge recomputation, then integrate statutory GST valuation only through reviewed source-backed policy paths. Actual per-fill invoice acceptance remains evidence-gated; no personal contract note is required.
- Safety unchanged: PR #6/#7 Draft and unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes and automatic live-fill promotion/scheduling disabled; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` untouched and out of scope.


## Phase 3 CI synchronization — 26 October 2026 (DP/demat snapshot gate)

- Latest verified code head: `6a6a3560aff18bb94d34b77640058a17d2a208b8`; exact-head Backend CI [#40381396722 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40381396722): **1,057 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill and retained restore evidence passed.
- Optional `demat_transaction_charges` can now be represented as a distinct pending canonical snapshot and allocated into the durable per-fill allocation ledger when source rows are independently reviewed. Migration expands the canonical snapshot vocabulary. It does **not** authorize final accounting: DP/demat reconciliation promotion deliberately fails closed until Execution persistence and total-charge recomputation are implemented.
- Next Phase 3 gate: add dedicated optional Execution DP/demat persistence and a single verified total-charge recomputation path, with migration/idempotency/rollback and delivery-vs-non-delivery tests. Keep actual invoice/per-fill acceptance evidence-gated; no personal contract note is required.
- Safety unchanged: PR #6/#7 Draft and unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes and automatic live-fill promotion/scheduling disabled; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` untouched and out of scope.

## Verified checkpoint — 27 October 2026 (DP/demat completeness)

- Backend CI #40459846143 succeeded on code/test commit `9400bc9aa221e2cf3b735e49a8e9a6d351237f02`: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40459846143. Backend pytest, broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore checks passed.
- DP completeness regression now checks invalid status serialization through `ExecutionOut`; status/amount inconsistencies and ineligible DP manifests remain fail-closed. Next gate: per-fill mapping, replay conflict/idempotency, rollback atomicity, and component applicability.
- Real contract-note and production Oracle backup/restore acceptance deferred until genuine evidence exists. Safety unchanged: target `tradepro-improved` only; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes disabled.

## Latest verified checkpoint — 27 October 2026 (per-fill allocation tamper rejection)

- Code/test commit `45b0fdc1622881fa0ed361bae6c28af64b59a5f1` passed exact-head Backend CI [#40460914796](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40460914796).
- Regression `test_tampered_per_fill_allocation_amount_blocks_live_accounting` changes a reviewed brokerage allocation by ₹0.01 and asserts promotion is rejected with execution/live-position unchanged and paper quantity preserved.
- Canonical verifier validates exact manifest fill-set, status, connection, INR currency, allocation basis/method, source total and deterministic paise amount. Existing tests cover missing components, non-reconciled rows, replay conflicts/idempotency and post-commit retry.
- Next: explicitly verify fill-set mismatch and rollback assertions, then component applicability. Statutory GST/IPFT acceptance remains separate from estimates. Real contract-note and Oracle production restore remain evidence-gated.
- Safety: only `tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` out of scope; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes disabled.


## Annual GST statement reconciliation finding — 27 October 2026

- A user-provided Upstox/RKSV annual global transaction statement for FY 2022–23 is annual aggregate evidence, not an individual contract note. Its visible charge rows do not by themselves establish a unique taxable base for the reported aggregate GST at paise precision.
- Preserve source-row labels exactly; do not relabel an STT rounding row as SEBI fees. Determine the base from underlying invoice/contract-note lines and the historical policy, not by selecting a charge merely to force arithmetic to match.
- The reconciliation helper retains reported-vs-expected variance instead of inferring or rewriting the base. Annual variance may reflect invoice-level rounding/aggregation or a charge omitted from the summarized lines; the annual statement alone cannot distinguish these.
- Do not use annual AGS totals to approve actual per-fill GST or promote canonical allocations. Next evidence gate: an itemized individual contract note or invoice-level breakdown. Keep FY 2022–23 evidence separate from the 2026 public-schedule estimate policy.
- This clarifies evidence scope; it does not change GST/IPFT policy or establish that the broker billed incorrectly. Personal identifiers and account-specific figures are intentionally not copied into this repository note.
- Latest code/test head before documentation sync: `9eb278588b78d2a966cc196c15d7a4d9a6ae8868`; Backend CI [#40505176395 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40505176395). This documentation update requires exact-head CI before it is marked green.
- Safety: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` out of scope; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes disabled.


## Session resume checkpoint — 27 October 2026 (API-first charges decision; supersedes older next-step wording)

- **Resume from this checkpoint only.** Latest verified documentation head before this session sync: `72b03ee5b5c7487bb94815ea8b6fc3aabb6f8352`; exact-head Backend CI [#40553171858 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40553171858). The run completed successfully for backend pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL + document-volume restore, and restore-evidence retention. It is newer than the earlier failed CI and supersedes it for the tested commit.
- **User decision:** do not let a tiny GST/IPFT rounding discrepancy (including the discussed ₹0.20 annual aggregate variance / sub-paise arithmetic) block paper trading or the core app. The app does not need to independently recreate every broker billing detail before progressing.
- **Paper-trade approach:** use Upstox Brokerage Details API as an estimate where available; otherwise use the existing GST/brokerage/tax engine as a fallback. A target of roughly 95% practical accuracy is acceptable for paper-trading estimates, provided charges are labelled estimated and used consistently. Historical backtests should disclose that current tariffs may differ from historical tariffs.
- **Actual trades:** broker executes and collects actual charges. Import broker-reported post-trade charges/statements where available. Upstox post-trade Trade Charges API is aggregate evidence and must not be misrepresented as per-fill booked-charge evidence. Keep estimates separate from actuals; preserve reconciliation safeguards for imported records without blocking unrelated app development.
- **Do not reopen GST/IPFT from zero or chase tiny rounding differences as a release blocker.** Retain the existing GST engine, tariff/source evidence, API field-path resolver, reconciliation service and tests. Revisit only a concrete integration defect, material systematic variance, or a scope needing evidence.
- **Actual next technical work:** (1) inspect and wire the GST API-vs-engine comparison into the real charge-data flow using the correct charge lines and supplier/place-of-supply inputs; (2) finish genuinely uncovered component-by-component per-fill accounting acceptance—fill identity, paise totals, source-to-canonical mapping, replay/idempotency, rollback and segment/product applicability; (3) keep unsupported BSE/MCX tariff scopes explicitly estimated/unverified until source-backed; (4) synchronize maintained docs and run exact-head CI.
- **Evidence correction:** user has supplied genuine Upstox/RKSV contract-note evidence for 23, 24, 25, 27 and 30 January 2023. Do not state that no personal contract note exists or ask the user to provide it again. Production Oracle backup/restore acceptance remains deferred until deployment backups exist.
- **Safety invariants:** work only in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is out of scope. PR #6 and PR #7 remain Draft/unmerged. PAPER mode mandatory; live broker order writes remain disabled. Do not merge.
- **First action next session:** verify the latest head and its CI, read this checkpoint's latest section, then continue from the caller-level API/GST integration and remaining accounting acceptance. Do not resume from the earlier failed CI or repeat already completed GST/IPFT research.


## API-first paper-trade charge estimation decision — 29 October 2026

- User-approved behavior: use Upstox's pre-trade Brokerage Details API for paper-fill charge estimates when it returns a complete, valid, internally consistent breakdown. Keep the existing deterministic local calculator as the automatic fallback if the API is unavailable, expired/unauthorized, incomplete, null/invalid, or inconsistent. This is estimation only, not live-trading/accounting promotion.
- Implementation added on the Phase 3 branch: `backend/app/services/paper_trade_charge_estimator.py` plus deterministic tests. `ExecutionService` now uses API-first estimates for market and matched limit paper fills and records `PAPER_UPSTOX_API_ESTIMATE` versus `PAPER_ESTIMATE` in the existing execution charge-source field. Components are accepted only when paise-exact supported components sum exactly to the API total; transaction, clearing and IPFT are combined once in the existing exchange-charge field. Unknown/incomplete fields fall back rather than block paper trading.
- Existing post-trade Upstox charges endpoint remains aggregate reconciliation evidence, not per-fill actuals. The API route already exists. GST reconciliation remains available without blocking paper-trade P&L.
- Implementation commits: `b90c09dc82a51181bc9eae422cb025eb79c65bcb`; default-enabled setting `UPSTOX_CHARGE_ESTIMATES_ENABLED`. CI disables network estimates only for the broad execution suite; mocked estimator tests cover API and fallback paths.
- Backend CI [#40755234415](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40755234415) — **SUCCESS** on code/test head `778e76d3554a3baedc41f0396276c1cb3dafc38f`: **1,197 passed, 1 warning**; broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore/evidence retention passed. Documentation sync head `d57dd476ecd6acebd4dc9e169912b877811a8166` still needs exact-head CI verification before it is called green.
- Next: continue the next uncovered Phase 3 accounting acceptance gate after CI recovery. Do not reopen GST/IPFT from zero or make minor estimate variance a paper-trading blocker. Safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker order writes disabled; original `Tradepro` out of scope.


## Authoritative Phase 3 engineering closure — 29 October 2026

This section supersedes older status/next-step notes above; earlier entries remain as historical audit trail.

**Status: Phase 3 engineering acceptance is complete for the agreed PAPER-mode scope.** This is not authorization to enable live broker writes, promote estimates to booked actuals, or merge Draft PRs.

**Verified code checkpoint:** `3a0c464afcb10261d1590607f8440affd21295a0`, Backend CI [#40878367369 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40878367369): **1,207 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary, SQLite upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, and restore-evidence retention passed. The new documentation head still requires its own CI run.

### Completed engineering scope

- Paise-exact deterministic per-fill allocation; source integrity/reviewer controls; canonical source-to-component mapping; explicit combined/split transaction-charge/IPFT handling.
- Idempotent replay and conflicting-replay rejection; locked charge verification; rollback protection for accounting/position mutation.
- Explicit DP/demat persistence and total completeness. Delivery SELL fails closed when required DP evidence is unknown, invalid, inconsistent, or missing.
- GST valuation and GST/API comparison primitives preserve Decimal/paise precision, state/place-of-supply, missing/null/zero distinctions, and review-required variances. They do not silently approve actual charges.
- Upstox Brokerage Details API first for PAPER estimates; hardcoded calculator fallback on unavailable/invalid/inconsistent responses. Persist source as `PAPER_UPSTOX_API_ESTIMATE` or `PAPER_HARDCODED_FALLBACK` and display: “Estimated charges may differ from actual broker charges. For paper trading only; these are not actual booked charges.”
- Post-trade Trade Charges API is aggregate-only evidence, never per-fill actuals; aggregate responses are sanitized before persistence/return.

### Non-blocking operational/release gates

Credentialed Upstox OAuth/API smoke testing and real Oracle/database-plus-document-volume restore acceptance require deployment and user-authorized credentials/backups. Tariffs without independently approved scope/date evidence remain estimate-only/fail-closed for actual accounting. Historical contract-note fixtures support regression tests; estimates and aggregate summaries never become booked per-fill actuals. These constraints do not block PAPER-mode engineering completion.

**Safety:** only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` untouched; PR #6/#7 Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes disabled. Phase 4 is the next separate increment after exact documentation-head CI passes.


## Resume checkpoint — 29 October 2026 (Upstox response-schema validation)

- **Code/test head:** `404c1e11ef4f2557c791c720c8d9a3fbc4e93bc1`; exact-head Backend CI [#40883660756 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40883660756). The workflow result confirms success; its summary did not expose a reliable pytest count, so no count is asserted here.
- **Concrete fix:** `UpstoxChargeApiOrchestrationService` no longer marks arbitrary successful HTTP JSON as usable. Brokerage estimates require `status == "success"` and `data.charges`; post-trade aggregate charges require `status == "success"` and `data.charges_breakdown`. Wrong/missing schema returns `usable=false`, clears the payload and records `INVALID_RESPONSE_SCHEMA`.
- **Regression coverage:** valid endpoint-specific response fixtures plus incorrect endpoint schema, unsuccessful/missing status, and aggregate wrong-shape payload cases.
- **Evidence boundary:** Brokerage Details remains estimate-only; Trade Charges remains aggregate reconciliation-only and never per-fill actual evidence. Null IPFT must not be silently coerced to zero. This fix validates response shape; it does not approve tariffs or promote accounting.
- **Contract-note continuity:** previously supplied January 2023 Upstox/RKSV contract-note examples remain available as historical regression fixtures; do not ask the user to provide them again. Their scope must be respected when using them for GST totals versus per-fill allocations.
- **Next:** verify CI on the exact synchronized documentation head. Keep PR #6/#7 Draft and unmerged, PAPER mode mandatory, live broker writes disabled, and the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository untouched.


## Phase 4 latest checkpoint — 30 October 2026

- Exact implementation SHA `6ac3882a98f3c66abb4cd62848971b6277ab3be7` passed Backend CI #41080156436: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/41080156436.
- Transactional PAPER stop-event claim service validates user/portfolio/strategy/instrument ownership, locks portfolio → strategy → position, rejects flat positions and ambiguous shared-position ownership, and persists unique quote identity with claim token/lease/attempt metadata. Duplicate claims are safely rejected through a savepoint.
- This service is storage/claim coordination only; it is not connected to the dispatcher or order execution.
- Next: PostgreSQL 16 multi-worker race tests, lease reclaim/state transitions, crash recovery, shared-position ownership policy, then gated PAPER integration.
- PR #9 remains Draft/unmerged; PAPER mandatory; live broker writes disabled; original Tradepro repository out of scope. Documentation commits require exact-head CI.
