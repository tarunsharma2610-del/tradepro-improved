## Brokerage cap entrypoint integration — 23 October 2026

- The previous exact-head implementation CI passed on commit [3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384): **712 passed, 1 warning**; SQLite/PostgreSQL migration round-trips, broker-write boundary guard, synthetic restore drill and evidence retention also passed.
- Follow-up review found the general `calculate_charge_for_trade` entry point selected an approved brokerage rule but bypassed the rule-bound minimum/maximum caps. Fixed it to route order-notional brokerage through `calculate_order_brokerage`, and added regression test `test_trade_charge_entrypoint_applies_caps_from_selected_brokerage_rule`. Code/test commits: [d6d60a03732ab322785d5e020f0521a4b96162c9](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/d6d60a03732ab322785d5e020f0521a4b96162c9) and [78f5f27135137a1d8f0882d2c0a91d013f6e8556](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/78f5f27135137a1d8f0882d2c0a91d013f6e8556).
- **The entrypoint follow-up has not yet been validated by CI.** Earlier 712-pass results do not cover these later code/test commits. CI for the resulting latest documentation head must complete before this gate is marked green.
- The cap-aware snapshot schema v4 records minimum/maximum values in the snapshot and rule fingerprint; same-event cap changes are conflicting replays. These helper functions do not prove official Upstox rates or legal/tax applicability, and the snapshot builder does not itself persist or promote charges.
- Automatic quantity/notional allocation remains disabled until reviewed, effective-dated component-specific tariff rules exist. Existing variance tests keep estimate-vs-actual comparisons review-only and do not promote charge ledger entries.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle Cloud recovery. All work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is out of scope.

## Rule-bound brokerage caps and passing CI — 23 October 2026

- Order-level brokerage minimum/maximum caps are now fields on the validated `TariffRule`, and are accepted only for order-notional brokerage rules. Caps must be finite, nonnegative, and paise-precise; minimum cannot exceed maximum.
- `calculate_order_brokerage` reads caps from the reviewed rule rather than caller-supplied parameters. Tariff estimate snapshot schema is now v4; snapshots include the cap values and include them in the rule fingerprint. Changing a cap for the same event produces a conflicting replay rather than a silent overwrite.
- Exact-head backend workflow [39976363279](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39976363279) passed on commit [3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/3445a748b3fbd3944362ed6e46873bffc30fd384): **712 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence retention passed.
- The warning is a Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning; the workflow also reports Node.js action-runtime deprecation warnings. They did not fail the run. Do not claim that this CI head verifies any later documentation-only commit until CI is checked for that exact head.
- This implementation does not establish official Upstox tariff rates or tax-law applicability; caps/rates must come from a reviewed source record. The snapshot helper itself does not persist estimates or promote them into actual charges. Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle Cloud recovery.
- Next accounting gate: verify aggregate order-level estimate-versus-actual variance handling, then rerun exact-head CI and synchronize all nine documents after any further changes. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order writes remain disabled.
- All work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Brokerage cap precision and CI checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Brokerage minimum and maximum inputs now reject values with more than two decimal places, avoiding sub-paise cap ambiguity. Regression tests cover sub-paise minimum and maximum values.
- Exact-head workflow run [39975215770](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39975215770) passed on commit [d650471895e6938b175434eff20b7d7421abb046](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/d650471895e6938b175434eff20b7d7421abb046): **709 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence retention completed successfully.
- The remaining warning is a third-party `starlette.testclient` / AnyIO deprecation warning; GitHub Actions also emitted Node.js action-runtime deprecation warnings. These did not fail the run and should be tracked separately from accounting correctness.
- The nine project documents are now being synchronized after this green code/test head. A new CI run for the resulting documentation commit is required before claiming that latest documentation head is green.
- This run's restore evidence is synthetic; it does not prove recovery of actual Oracle Cloud production data. Calculation helpers validate structure and precision, not official Upstox rates or legal/tax applicability.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending accounting acceptance review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. All work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Latest Phase 3 CI checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Stamp-duty regression setup was corrected in commit [c98d13d86031ffe173546dbbc9c8b0234e02456e](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/c98d13d86031ffe173546dbbc9c8b0234e02456e): invalid-basis test cases now explicitly select the intended `BUY` transaction side so each case reaches the basis guard it is designed to exercise.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39974055917](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39974055917) passed on that code/test commit: **707 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence retention all passed.
- Existing tests already cover inclusive effective-date boundaries, expiry of old tariff rules, overlapping approved-rule rejection, deterministic largest-remainder paise allocation, input-order independence, zero-weight residual handling, and exact source-total reconciliation. Do not duplicate these tests; review whether the rules are wired into real reviewed component-specific tariff selection before enabling automatic allocation.
- Brokerage and GST calculation helpers and stamp-duty side/product/base guards are arithmetic safeguards only. They do not establish official Upstox tariff rates or tax-law applicability. Authentic contract-note verification and actual Oracle Cloud backup recovery remain separate evidence/deployment gates.
- The documentation files are being synchronized after this green code/test head. Rerun CI on the resulting latest documentation commit before claiming the complete latest head is green.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending accounting acceptance review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Work is exclusively in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Phase 3 — durable per-fill charge allocation verification — 23 October 2026

- Latest test refinement commit: [e73c9cbb8b5c4e34abe9874b548dbae5cbf762af](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/e73c9cbb8b5c4e34abe9874b548dbae5cbf762af). The PostgreSQL concurrency test now only treats the expected `ValueError` for pending/unreconciled allocation rows as a valid fail-closed outcome; unexpected exceptions fail the test.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39971530839](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39971530839) passed: **688 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration round-trip, PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and retained restore evidence all passed.
- This run validates synthetic test fixtures and restore mechanics only. It does not validate an authentic personal Upstox contract note or prove restoration of the user's actual Oracle Cloud backup.
- The nine required project documents are being synchronized after this green code/test head; rerun CI on the resulting latest documentation commit before calling the documentation checkpoint current.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending complete accounting/idempotency review and explicit user approval. Live broker order submission remains disabled. All work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## PostgreSQL CI execution confirmation — 24 October 2026

- Inspected `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` and successful Backend pytest run [39921411680](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39921411680) on commit `db1053d7f7c53e1c57016f153f11c9897fa59682`. The workflow provisions PostgreSQL 16, sets `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` for `python -m pytest -q`, and the Backend pytest job completed successfully. Thus the `skipif(not TEST_POSTGRES_URL)` PostgreSQL-only tests were enabled for that run (job logs/test output should be consulted if exact per-test counts are needed).
- The workflow also passed Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks on SQLite and PostgreSQL 16, the broker-write-boundary guard, and an isolated synthetic database/document-volume restore drill.
- The restore drill uses synthetic data created inside CI. It does not substitute for restoring the user's actual retained Oracle Cloud backup or validating an authentic account-specific Upstox contract note.
- The existing source-verification/promotion race test covers allocation-ledger functions, but the integrated concurrency scenario that races real `LiveFillAccountingService.promote_trade` against ledger verification/promotion remains open. Do not mark Phase 3 accounting sign-off complete until that integration gap is addressed or explicitly accepted with evidence.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled. All changes are confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.

---

## Phase 3 concurrency integration status — 24 October 2026

- Current branch head before this documentation update: `2cacf392e5104a8b16307395847239bba945c87b`; branch-head backend CI run [39920815737](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39920815737) passed. PR #6 is draft and unmerged.
- The PostgreSQL-only allocation concurrency suite already contains `test_concurrent_source_verification_and_promotion_serialize_on_evidence`. It concurrently runs the real `verify_component_allocation_ledger` and `promote_verified_component_allocations` functions against synthetic persisted evidence and asserts that both allocations finish reconciled under one reconciliation reference.
- This is a useful source-ledger race test, but it is not the same as a concurrent call to `LiveFillAccountingService.promote_trade` using the real `_load_reconciled_allocation_fees` path while ledger verification/promotion races. That end-to-end live-fill integration scenario remains unproven and is still an acceptance gate.
- The other PostgreSQL allocation test races competing fill sets for a source component and expects exactly one fill set to own that component. Tests are skipped locally without `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`; CI must be checked to confirm the PostgreSQL service actually ran these tests rather than only passing via skips.
- Next engineering task: add or extend a disposable-PostgreSQL integration test using reviewed synthetic evidence, real reconciled allocations, and the actual live-fill accounting service. Assert no partial execution/position writes on failed verification, exactly-once replay, and no acceptance of a conflicting/unreconciled ledger. Then verify the exact resulting head's job logs and test counts.
- Real account-specific broker contract-note validation and restoration from an actual retained Oracle Cloud PostgreSQL/document backup remain separate operational checks.
- Live broker order submission remains disabled. PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. All work remains confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.

## Final conflict-recovery review checkpoint — 24 October 2026

- Reviewed `LiveFillAccountingService.promote_trade` replay and `IntegrityError` recovery paths on branch head `78c66b50714175df7e6923fa0e9328b98bb30cf2`.
- Existing-execution replay locks and refreshes the broker trade record, checks its immutable execution snapshot, and compares execution identity, fill details, charge values and evidence before returning `inserted=False`; conflicting details fail closed.
- The integrity-conflict recovery rolls back the losing transaction, re-queries the execution by broker connection/trade identity, and only returns an idempotent result when the existing execution matches; otherwise it raises a conflict requiring review. Generic failures also roll back.
- Latest branch-head backend pytest CI passed in run [39920205395](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39920205395). The concurrent PostgreSQL test uses a test-only stub for the charge-ledger loader, so it verifies parent/child locking and duplicate-promotion behavior, not the real allocation verifier under the same concurrency interleaving. Ledger validation is covered by separate accounting tests. Do not overstate this as a full production-like concurrent allocation integration test.
- Review status: the inspected replay/rollback paths have coverage and no additional code change is justified by this inspection alone. Phase 3 accounting sign-off is still gated on a final review of the real verifier/promotion concurrency interaction and confirmation of exact-head CI after this documentation update.
- Real broker contract-note authenticity and a restore drill from an actual retained Oracle Cloud PostgreSQL/document backup remain outstanding operational acceptance checks.
- PR #6 stays draft and unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled. Changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is untouched.

---

## Phase 3 accounting checkpoint — 24 October 2026

- The concurrent exact-replay PostgreSQL regression passed in implementation CI run [39919563611](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39919563611) for commit `f8441f6d11b863e3ad173282664663cd4985eeb2`. The test exercises two distinct fills and a simultaneous duplicate promotion, expecting two inserted executions and one idempotent replay.
- Documentation checkpoint run [39919590316](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39919590316) passed for commit `c99e4972cf4c2c902bddc076af6327c3bfd25fa7`.
- The next documentation CI checkpoint is still in progress: progress run `39919920878` succeeded, while handover run `39919925329` and audit run `39919932771` were in progress at last inspection. These are earlier documentation heads; any newly synchronized documentation needs its own exact-head CI.
- Accounting review remains open pending exact-head verification and final adversarial review. Passing tests are evidence for covered cases, not a guarantee against every possible concurrency interleaving.
- Real account-specific contract-note validation and restore of an actual retained Oracle Cloud PostgreSQL/document backup remain operational acceptance checks. Synthetic CI restore drills do not satisfy those real-environment checks.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled. All work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository is out of scope.

## Current acceptance clarification — 23 October 2026

- **Public contract-note research is complete for development:** third-party examples dated 12 March 2025 and 21 May 2024, plus a sample-note guide, were reviewed for structure and charge categories. See `docs/UPSTOX_CONTRACT_NOTE_AND_API_EVIDENCE.md`.
- The examples are not independently authenticated. No raw public document, personal identifier, or invented “real” evidence is stored in this repository. The checked-in Upstox-style fixture remains explicitly synthetic.
- **A personal/account-specific contract note is not required to continue or complete Phase 3 engineering.** It remains optional future validation for account-specific source authenticity and charge comparison; public aggregate figures must not be treated as proof of per-fill amounts.
- A separate real retained database/document backup and restore test remains a deployment/operational acceptance gate for the Oracle Free Cloud environment. Synthetic CI restore results do not prove recovery of real user data.
- Exact-head CI on commit `18c897a282ea5f8e7c6a55707ad24b6cf8da5b27` passed in [run 39915983869](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39915983869). This does not substitute for the next CI run after this documentation clarification.
- This section supersedes older checkpoint wording below that may imply a personal contract note is required before Phase 3 engineering can proceed. Historical notes remain for audit traceability.
- Scope: `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order writes remain disabled.

---

## Phase 3 allocation-weight integrity checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Code review found that a charge ledger could sum to the correct source total while its individual per-fill amounts did not follow the reviewed allocation basis. Reconciliation now recomputes and verifies each fill's expected amount before promotion.
- Added migration `202610230013` and persisted canonical reviewer-approved weights for `EXPLICIT_REVIEWED`. Source review requires one weight per eligible fill; `QUANTITY` and `NOTIONAL` bases derive weights from persisted broker-trade quantity and price. The verifier checks the complete fill set, basis, method, total, and each per-fill allocation.
- Added regression coverage for a tampered per-fill split that preserves the aggregate total.
- Exact-head CI [run 39912330029](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39912330029) passed on code commit `776ee59485d79b880d7aee0f5c3ecb641eb7db3f`: **567 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore all passed.
- This CI result validates that code commit only; the documentation commits now being synchronized require a new exact-head run. Synthetic restore evidence is not proof of recovery of actual Oracle Free Cloud data or authenticity of a real Upstox contract note.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending the final review and explicit user approval. Live broker writes remain disabled. Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 promotion rollback guard — 22 October 2026

- Exact-head CI run [39813721425](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39813721425) **PASSED** on commit `121741f32ff74c46ccc059f672b3e9f0e020ef14`: backend pytest **565 passed, 1 warning**; configured PostgreSQL 16 migration/safety checks completed successfully.
- Added a regression test that injects a flush failure during charge-allocation promotion and verifies that, after rollback/reload, all allocation rows remain `PENDING_RECONCILIATION` with no reconciliation reference.
- This CI result validates the above commit only. Any subsequent documentation commits require a fresh exact-head run.
- PR #6 remains open, draft, and unmerged pending continued accounting review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled.
- Synthetic restore evidence does not prove recovery of the user's real Oracle Free Cloud data or authenticity of a real broker contract note. Real-data acceptance remains deferred until the user supplies the evidence.
- Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only. Do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 exact-head CI checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Latest exact-head workflow: [GitHub Actions run 39808404362](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39808404362) **PASSED** on commit `1fcbb06a78fd06226f0e0e6438cf72b422dc2d4e`.
- Backend pytest: **563 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard passed. SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed. Isolated synthetic PostgreSQL/database + document-volume restore drill and evidence-retention step passed.
- This supersedes earlier “CI pending” notes for commits before this exact head only. Do not treat older commits' results as validation of this head.
- The restore drill uses synthetic data and does not prove restoration of the user's real Oracle Free Cloud database or authentic broker contract-note files.
- PR #6 remains open, draft, and unmerged. Keep it draft until the accounting/idempotency review and user approval. Live broker write operations remain disabled.
- Next: review durable per-fill accounting idempotency/rollback and reconcile any remaining Phase 3 acceptance gates; real broker-note and retained real-backup evidence can be supplied later by the user.
- Repository scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 source-reconciliation safety correction — 22 October 2026

- Code review identified a safety gap in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py`: the service previously marked rows `RECONCILED` merely because calculated allocations summed to the caller-provided component total. That is arithmetic reconciliation, not independent verification of a broker contract-note source total.
- Fixed in commit `fce01b98ce33760e3361991e8d2ffba01b0ad281`: newly persisted allocations remain `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`; this service clears the reconciliation reference and does not promote them to `RECONCILED`. A separate source-verification workflow must establish provenance and validate the source component total before promotion.
- Updated regression expectation in commit `8c38ab8ecc8114f392e11ea988ac25c3d7c8e2df` to assert pending status and no reconciliation reference even when arithmetic totals match.
- **Historical CI note superseded:** exact-head CI passed on commit `1fcbb06a78fd06226f0e0e6438cf72b422dc2d4e`; see the Phase 3 exact-head CI checkpoint at the top of this file.
- This deliberately fails closed: matching a number supplied by the caller is not treated as proof that it came from an authentic contract note. Contract-note authenticity/parser, component-specific allocation methodology, source-total verification, and controlled accounting integration remain open Phase 3 gates.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged pending exact-head CI and broader review. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 allocation edge-case hardening — 22 October 2026

- Code review found a rounding edge case in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_service.py`: when a source total was one paise and a zero-weight fill ID sorted before positive-weight IDs, the deterministic largest-remainder tie-break could assign that paise to a fill whose weight was zero.
- Fixed in commit `1f04b5d0c0fc07af15eadd4fe7c70f14ff054f91`: only strictly positive-weight fills participate in residual ranking. Zero-weight fills remain in the result at INR 0.00.
- Added regression coverage in commit `347f9588485bd7452d949dd816ba6966196354f6` for the one-paise/tied-remainder case and the two-paise case.
- **Verification pending:** CI for these code/test commits and the following documentation commits must pass on the exact latest branch head before this fix is called verified. The prior PostgreSQL concurrency success does not include this new change.
- Existing successful PostgreSQL concurrency run: `39737580271` on `d59e7d8`, `527 passed, 1 warning`, with `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` set. New allocation edge-case fix is a separate code change and needs fresh CI.
- Source authenticity, component-appropriate allocation policy, exact source-total reconciliation against real contract-note data, and accounting integration remain release gates. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 PostgreSQL concurrency verification — 22 October 2026

- **Verified green:** GitHub Actions run `39737580271`, commit `d59e7d8a613471c3134b8d0c6dcdb326713ce7eb`, completed successfully. Job `Backend pytest` passed; log summary: `527 passed, 1 warning in 32.20s`.
- The test job environment explicitly set `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` to the dedicated PostgreSQL 16 service. The suite reported no skipped tests, so the opt-in PostgreSQL integration test was not skipped in this run.
- The preceding fixture corrections addressed (1) missing `Base` import and (2) parent user row not flushed before dependent records. The subsequent exact-head run is green.
- This is evidence that the new PostgreSQL concurrency integration test completed successfully in the suite. Keep its specific invariant documented: competing independent sessions target one evidence/component with different fill sets; only one allocation should persist, without partial/mixed rows.
- Remaining gates are not closed by this test: authenticated contract-note provenance/schema, reviewed charge-component allocation methodology and residual handling, reconciliation against source totals, and controlled integration with live-fill accounting still need review/acceptance. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending review of the full change and its broader release gates.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## PostgreSQL concurrency-test fixture correction — 22 October 2026

- Inspected failed workflow `39737225306` on commit `d6a9cab`. PostgreSQL test failed during fixture setup, before the race assertion: the `broker_connections.user_id` foreign key referenced a user not yet flushed to PostgreSQL. The suite result was `1 failed, 526 passed, 1 warning`.
- Fixed in code commit `0c4d5133a1224fbac5b0eb2cafb3b7c195612d40`: explicitly flush the user parent row before adding dependent portfolio/instrument/connection rows. No production behavior was changed.
- **Pending:** exact-head CI for `0c4d513` and subsequent documentation commits. Do not infer that the concurrency test passes from this fixture correction alone.
- Acceptance remains: on PostgreSQL, two independent sessions race different fill sets against the same evidence/component; exactly one complete allocation set succeeds, the other fails closed, and no partial/mixed ledger remains.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged until this test and exact-head CI pass. Contract-note authenticity, allocation methodology review, and accounting integration remain separate gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## PostgreSQL concurrency-test CI correction — 22 October 2026

- First run of the new integration test failed before reaching the race assertion: `NameError: Base is not defined` in test schema setup. Suite result was `1 failed, 526 passed, 1 warning` on commit `1859179`.
- Fixed by importing `Base` from `app.core.database` in commit `eb4b6c4`. This is a test setup correction only; it does not weaken production checks.
- **Pending verification:** CI for `eb4b6c4` and the documentation commits is not yet confirmed green. The PostgreSQL test's runtime race behavior remains unverified until it executes successfully against the CI PostgreSQL 16 service.
- The test provisions isolated records and races two independent sessions against one evidence/component. Acceptance criterion: exactly one allocation request succeeds, the other fails closed, and exactly one allocation row remains.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until exact-head CI passes and the concurrency result is inspected. Evidence authenticity, valid charge basis, and integration with live accounting remain separate gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 PostgreSQL concurrency test added — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`, an opt-in integration test that uses `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`, two independent SQLAlchemy sessions and concurrent threads to race incompatible single-fill allocations against one reviewed evidence record/component. The expected result is exactly one winner and one persisted allocation, with no mixed/partial fill set.
- The existing `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` provisions PostgreSQL 16 and exports `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`; the integration test creates ORM metadata in that dedicated CI test database because pytest runs before the later Alembic migration verification step.
- Test setup was corrected to build the required portfolio → instrument → order → broker-order → broker-trade foreign-key chain. Test commits: `a69e083`, `4b5e8cc`, `1859179`.
- **Pending:** this new PostgreSQL concurrency test has not yet been confirmed green by exact-head CI. A green prior run does not cover these commits. If CI fails, inspect the test output and correct the fixture or concurrency assumptions before claiming safety.
- The evidence-row `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` is the serialization point. This integration test is the empirical verification needed; SQLite-only unit tests are insufficient.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending successful exact-head CI and review. Contract-note authenticity, component-appropriate allocation basis and live accounting integration remain separate release gates. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 continuation — PostgreSQL concurrency test still required — 22 October 2026

- Latest confirmed successful workflow remains `39735969492` on commit `a94760f66d5405a563cca25960c95f00ba2a4e5f`; it is a PR-triggered backend-tests run. No later code change is represented by that result.
- Rechecked the allocation persistence service and test setup. The default test fixture explicitly forces SQLite in-memory; it does not exercise PostgreSQL row locks. The workflow file is named `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` (not `ci.yml`).
- Source evidence is locked with SQLAlchemy `with_for_update()` before fill rows and existing allocations are queried. This is a plausible PostgreSQL serialization point but is not yet race-tested with two independent transactions.
- Next step remains an opt-in integration test using a dedicated PostgreSQL test database/URL and two independent sessions racing different fill sets against the same evidence/component. The test must assert one complete winner and one fail-closed conflict, with no partial rows. CI must provision PostgreSQL or clearly report the integration test as skipped; a skipped test is not proof of safety.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged pending that test and exact-head green CI. Source document authenticity, allocation-basis review and accounting-service integration remain separate release gates. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled.
- All changes in this project remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 checkpoint — concurrency safeguard and verification boundary — 22 October 2026

- Confirmed latest recorded successful GitHub Actions run for this branch: `39735332590`, commit `9ed382f5872faaf2c20f71e4292ac5cc3baf322f` (backend tests, success).
- The source-evidence `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock is implemented in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py` before fill-set lookup/allocation persistence. This is intended to serialize concurrent allocations for the same evidence on PostgreSQL.
- **Important verification limit:** the green run is for commit `9ed382f`; it does not include any later changes. The current test file still lacks a PostgreSQL-backed concurrent allocation test. Do not claim race-safety has been empirically proven until that test runs against PostgreSQL with two independent sessions/transactions.
- Next implementation step: add an opt-in integration test using a dedicated PostgreSQL test URL (e.g. `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`) that starts two transactions attempting incompatible fill sets against one evidence/component; verify the second waits/re-reads the ledger and fails closed without partial rows. If CI does not provide a PostgreSQL service for pytest, add a dedicated PostgreSQL test job rather than treating SQLite `FOR UPDATE` behavior as equivalent.
- After the test, run full exact-head CI, inspect logs, and update this checkpoint with the observed result. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until verified.
- Charge-note authenticity, appropriate per-component allocation methodology, and accounting-service integration remain review gates. No automatic accounting promotion or live broker submission is enabled.
- Scope remains exclusively `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 concurrent allocation serialization — 22 October 2026

- Latest previously verified CI head `9e07a5c95401ab3ccfd6c32a8223721dd573b928` passed, including backend pytest, broker write-boundary enforcement, and Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade on SQLite and PostgreSQL 16.
- Code commit `34dd6cebb424f50963a3ca788de37490d39bdb60` adds a row-level lock on the reviewed `BrokerChargeEvidence` record before locking fill rows and inspecting/inserting component allocations. Rationale: locking only the target fills does not serialize two concurrent requests using disjoint fill sets against the same evidence/component; both could otherwise observe an empty ledger and insert different subsets. PostgreSQL's evidence-row lock provides a per-source serialization point.
- **Pending validation:** run exact-head CI for `34dd6ce` and the documentation commits. SQLite does not enforce `FOR UPDATE`; green SQLite tests alone are not proof of concurrency behavior. Add or run a PostgreSQL-backed concurrent test before treating race safety as fully verified.
- No live accounting promotion was enabled. Evidence authenticity and the economic correctness of a selected allocation basis remain review-gated.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. All changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Replay-basis test correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest CI failed on head `bac124af41342293e5bceba8d5641e85184bee16`: `525 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning`. The new test supplied `ALTERNATE_REVIEWED`, which is intentionally not a supported allocation basis; validation rejected it before replay-conflict detection.
- Test-only correction committed as `6b91827d6a4a01ea93009d664d467ca32d5ec342`: the test now uses `QUANTITY`, a supported basis distinct from the original `EXPLICIT_REVIEWED`, so it exercises the intended changed-basis replay guard without weakening production validation.
- **Pending:** exact-head CI for `6b91827` and documentation updates must pass before replay-basis coverage is marked green.
- Concurrency review remains open: unique evidence/trade/component rows protect duplicate per-fill rows, but do not alone prove correct handling of concurrent conflicting fill sets. PostgreSQL integration coverage is required.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 rollback CI verified; replay-basis test added — 22 October 2026

- CI run `39734057700` passed for commit `85e022e630682da50b1b9e906a8b5986e541d97b`. This confirms the explicit SQLite transaction-boundary correction fixed the rollback test on that head.
- Added a new regression test to reject a replay that changes the reviewed allocation basis, while preserving the existing exact-replay behavior. Test commits: `3f912a1b02cea3880cd7020dea88fa9cbf1185f9` and helper correction `25695e5fc6a1d65f9344bd44f3229c9fa90a69a0`.
- **Pending verification:** the new replay-basis test and following documentation commits have not yet passed exact-head CI. Do not count them as green until CI completes.
- Concurrency note: the model has a unique constraint on evidence + trade + component, which prevents duplicate rows for a fill, but it does not by itself serialize concurrent requests that race with different fill sets. Before merge, add/review a database-backed concurrency strategy and test on PostgreSQL; SQLite alone cannot prove row-lock semantics.
- Still not proven: contract-note authenticity, legally/economically appropriate allocation basis, and integration with live accounting. No automatic accounting promotion is enabled.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Work remains confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## SQLite rollback test infrastructure correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest exact-head CI `39733775193` failed again: `524 passed, 1 failed`. The explicit session transaction still did not roll back the rows because SQLite's legacy driver transaction mode did not issue a physical `BEGIN` before the service's nested SAVEPOINT.
- Test-only infrastructure correction committed as `d49e3cdfae519dc7d7f80bdcda882fcaa6842c51`: configure the in-memory SQLite test engine with explicit transaction boundaries (disable driver-managed implicit transaction control and emit `BEGIN` on SQLAlchemy's begin event). This is the documented SQLAlchemy pattern for reliable SAVEPOINT behavior; it changes test setup, not production database code.
- **Pending:** rerun CI for this commit and documentation updates; only mark rollback coverage resolved if the test passes.
- If the rollback test still fails, stop and replace it with a database-specific integration test rather than weakening the assertion. Concurrent conflicting replay tests remain next after green CI.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Rollback-test CI failure and correction — 22 October 2026

- CI run `39733515473` failed at commit `c9adf3b9da90e1a2d350c216ccdb923ac3ba41a8`: **524 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning**. The only failure was the new rollback test, which assumed the shared SQLite test session had a real outer transaction. The fixture commits setup records, and SQLite can release a SAVEPOINT without an explicit outer `BEGIN`.
- Corrective test commit: `f941b4bf32c8be77ad4c8c17811632ed77b540f0`. The test now starts an explicit outer transaction around the allocation service and rolls that transaction back before asserting no allocation rows remain. This tests caller-owned transaction rollback instead of relying on SQLite's implicit transaction behavior.
- **Pending verification:** exact-head CI for `f941b4b` and the documentation commits must pass before this rollback regression is considered resolved.
- No application transaction semantics were changed by this test-only correction. The service still leaves commit/rollback to its caller. Remaining follow-up: concurrent conflicting replay tests and database-level serialization review.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 rollback test checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Exact-head CI verified green for the corrected connection-safety assertion and latest documentation head `a19313ccba7c2fe79c6ac588d3acb81cd4168dce`; run `39733212480` and latest docs run `39733267668` both completed successfully.
- Added `test_outer_transaction_rollback_removes_all_new_allocations` in commit `c9adf3b9da90e1a2d350c216ccdb923ac3ba41a8`. It confirms the persistence service does not commit on the caller's behalf and a caller rollback removes all allocation rows created in that transaction.
- **Pending:** run exact-head CI for the rollback test and subsequent documentation commits. Do not count this new test as passed until the run succeeds.
- Remaining review: database-level uniqueness already guards duplicate evidence/trade/component rows; simultaneous imports can still require stronger serialization/unique source-component identity and explicit conflicting concurrent replay coverage. Source-document authenticity and allocation-basis suitability remain manual/review-gated; no accounting promotion is wired.
- Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged and live broker submission/automatic accounting promotion gated. Changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Follow-up CI diagnosis — 22 October 2026

- The corrected-fixture CI run `39732808218` failed after executing the tests: **523 passed, 1 failed, 1 warning**. The remaining failure was an overly specific expected error-message regex in the cross-connection rejection test; the service correctly rejected the trade with `Every broker trade record must belong to the evidence connection.`
- Fix committed as `6ff7d5bfc442f7fa06f6df9299b23199faf04d3d`: align the assertion with the service's actual safety error. This is a test assertion correction, not a relaxation of the connection guard.
- The exact-head CI for `6ff7d5b` must be checked before declaring the regression resolved.
- Next after CI passes: add explicit rollback coverage, then review concurrent/replayed allocation behavior and database constraints. Keep PR #6 draft/unmerged until the full required checks pass.
- Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.

---

## CI failure analysis and correction — 22 October 2026

- Latest persistence-test CI failed on commit `f7d84cd695192e59bee12f1de625e570746a2e88`: backend pytest reported `519 passed, 1 warning, 5 errors`.
- Root cause from the job log: all five new persistence tests requested a `reviewed_evidence` fixture that did not exist. This was test setup failure, not evidence that the allocation assertions passed.
- Corrective commit `a1149cbff48357fd9aab006de7fe3435a89cbed0` adds a local fixture creating a user, broker connection, and reviewed contract-note evidence row using the actual model fields. The new commit must still pass exact-head CI before this issue can be considered resolved.
- Next: verify CI for the corrected head. If green, add rollback and concurrency/replay tests. If it fails, inspect job logs and fix before proceeding.
- No merge; no live-accounting promotion. Work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not original `Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 persistence-test checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added database-backed tests for successful component allocation and exact source-total reconciliation, idempotent identical replay, conflicting replay with changed total, cross-connection trade rejection, and changed fill-set rejection without partial rows.
- Tests use the existing isolated SQLAlchemy test-session fixture. They are committed to the Phase 3 branch; exact-head CI for this test commit and the documentation commits still needs verification.
- Review note: the current persistence service marks a component `RECONCILED` as soon as stored allocations sum to the source total. This is arithmetic reconciliation only, not proof that the chosen allocation basis is correct or the source document is authentic. No live-fill accounting promotion is wired to it.
- **Next:** verify exact-head CI; fix test/migration issues. Then add explicit transaction rollback coverage and consider DB-level concurrency/idempotency enforcement for simultaneous identical/conflicting imports before any merge.
- Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain gated. All changes are confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is not the target.

---

## Phase 3 transactional allocation persistence checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_persistence_service.py` to validate reviewed contract-note evidence, enforce that every referenced persisted broker trade belongs to the same broker connection, and persist per-fill component allocations in a database savepoint.
- Replay handling: identical replay requests return the existing allocation rows; changed fill sets, totals, allocation values, basis, method version, currency, or rejected rows fail closed. Allocations are marked `RECONCILED` only when the full fill set exists and the sum equals the source component total exactly.
- This service uses the existing deterministic largest-remainder utility and writes a reconciliation reference. It does not authenticate the original contract-note document, choose an economically/legal basis, parse broker files, or enable accounting promotion.
- **Validation still required:** exact-head CI and DB-backed integration tests for successful allocation, identical replay, conflicting replay, cross-connection fill rejection, partial failure rollback, and migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade. Treat the implementation as unverified until those pass.
- **Next:** run CI, add database-backed persistence tests and repair issues found; then review concurrency/idempotency behavior and synchronize the PR description/docs. Do not merge until exact-head CI is green.
- Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. Changes remain limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

---

## Phase 3 allocation-math checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/broker_charge_allocation_service.py` with deterministic largest-remainder allocation math using Decimal values and integer paise, stable fill-ID tie-breaking, explicit method version, and source-total equality check.
- Added regression tests for source-total reconciliation, input-order independence, tie-breaking, zero weights, invalid/negative/non-finite values, unsupported basis, and paise precision.
- **Important limitation:** this is a pure allocation-math utility, not yet the durable persistence/orchestration service. It does not read reviewed evidence, bind trade rows to a connection, write immutable ledger rows, reconcile stored component totals across all fills, or gate execution promotion. A caller must select an explicitly reviewed basis appropriate to the charge component; no basis is inferred here.
- Existing schema migration/model slice had CI success at PR head `1505b71198f7f9f42ad749588597b7c8bb63eb0d`, run [39730707245](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39730707245). The newer service/tests/docs commits still require exact-head CI verification.
- **Next:** verify latest CI and correct failures; then implement a transactional persistence service that validates reviewed evidence + same-connection trades, inserts replay-safe rows, and marks a component reconciled only when the allocations sum exactly to its source total. Add DB-backed tests for idempotency, conflicting replays, foreign-connection evidence/trades, and rollback.
- Keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. All work remains in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` must remain untouched.

---

## Phase 3 allocation-ledger implementation checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- **Branch:** `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation` (based on verified main `54342a69249c9a790544c415842ec74c9ddf57fb`).
- **Initial implementation slice:** added `BrokerChargeAllocation` model and migration `202610220010`, registered the model, and added schema-contract tests. Ledger fields capture source evidence, broker connection, broker trade record, charge component, source component total, allocated amount in INR paise precision, allocation basis, method version, reconciliation state, and an optional reconciliation reference.
- **Idempotency constraint:** unique `(evidence_id, broker_trade_record_id, charge_component)`; supported components and nonnegative amounts are database-constrained. New rows default to `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`.
- **Not yet complete:** this is the durable schema foundation only. There is not yet a persistence/allocation service, cross-record validation that evidence and trade belong to the same connection, immutable-update enforcement, deterministic rounding/residual algorithm, source-total reconciliation, or linkage to execution promotion. Do not claim live accounting is using this ledger.
- **Verification:** exact-head CI has not yet been observed for this branch. Do not merge until backend tests and SQLite/PostgreSQL migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks pass.
- **Next:** validate migration/tests, add a service that uses Decimal/paise arithmetic only when an explicitly reviewed basis is authorized, enforces evidence/connection/trade binding and replay-safe inserts, and reconciles each source component total exactly. Ambiguous allocations must remain pending and block promotion.
- **Safety/scope:** keep live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion gated. All changes are limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## Latest verified Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Code/test commit:** `42a7418c674d92af9d099b1095d90af660678e2b` on `phase3/reviewed-charge-evidence-gate` in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.
- **Exact-head CI:** GitHub Actions run [39638875688](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39638875688) completed successfully. Backend pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, and PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passed.
- **New regression coverage:** rejects charge evidence from non-contract-note sources and mismatched reviewer identities. Existing evidence validation covers connection binding, reference matching, reviewed status, reviewer identity and review timestamp.
- **Scope and safety:** PR #5 remains open and unmerged as of this checkpoint. Evidence metadata/hash and a review status are provenance/workflow controls, not cryptographic proof of broker authenticity. Contract-note parsing/import, immutable per-fill charge allocation, deterministic paise rounding/residual handling, source-total reconciliation, and complete replay/partial-fill/crash-recovery acceptance remain unfinished.
- **Next:** continue with a reviewed contract-note import boundary and a durable, idempotent per-fill allocation ledger; do not invent charge splits. Keep live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling disabled until release gates pass.
- **Repository constraint:** changes must remain in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify the original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository.

<!-- Authoritative checkpoint refresh: 21 October 2026. Scope: tradepro-improved only. -->

## Authoritative Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Current code-and-documentation HEAD before this documentation sync:** `4fe58dd11b018d1f85000540ad2ec1b7f6f52ae5`. Its exact-HEAD push CI [run 39633514414](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633514414) completed successfully. Backend pytest, broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade-downgrade-reupgrade checks all passed.
- **Evidence-ledger implementation:** `6c0a382eb9fea7f386433cfdb65a65cbc53f218e`; migration correction: `c17f522bf68121a6d162a4d858cd9de8b95d45d1`. Their CI runs [39633266180](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633266180) and [39633330531](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39633330531) both passed.
- **Implemented:** `BrokerChargeEvidence` model and migration `202610210009`; captures broker connection, report metadata, filename, SHA-256 fingerprint, byte size, parser version, and review status. Tests cover persistence, duplicate-fingerprint rejection per connection, and database constraints.
- **Limits:** a hash detects byte-level changes but does not prove broker origin. The ledger does not yet retain document bytes, import/parse the broker document, establish authenticity, or allocate charge components to fills. `REVIEWED` is a workflow status, not automatic approval to promote live accounting.
- **Next Phase 3 gate:** build a fail-closed, idempotent contract-note import/review boundary and inspect a real redacted broker contract note before selecting charge-specific allocation rules. Then implement immutable per-fill allocation records, paise rounding/residual rules, source-total reconciliation, and replay/crash/partial-fill tests.
- **Phase 3 remains in progress.** Keep live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling disabled. Phase 2 remains closed. All changes must stay in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
- Older checkpoints below are historical; this section is authoritative until replaced by a later verified checkpoint.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current Phase 3 checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Latest verified code/test HEAD:** `3963c2bf4e6ffe2bb33d327b10e2995cd243d003`. Exact-head [Backend CI run 39607630055](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39607630055) passed **484 tests, 1 warning in 29.34s**; the broker-write boundary guard passed, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- New Phase 3 guard: broker-reported live-fill charge references are trimmed for storage and rejected when longer than the `Execution.charge_reference` 200-character column limit. This prevents a predictable storage error from being misreported as a concurrent promotion conflict. Regression coverage is included in the 484-test result.
- The existing Phase 3 safety gates remain active: replay must match the accounted fill and exact charge evidence; only broker-reported, internally consistent charges with a non-empty audit reference are accepted; durable staged trade quantities must match broker-confirmed child fills before promotion; exchange-time ambiguity/out-of-order fills fail closed; paper positions and cash remain isolated.
- **Phase 3 remains in progress, not complete.** Remaining review includes coordinator/identity boundaries, charge provenance/allocation semantics, full partial-fill and crash/restart acceptance criteria, and any explicitly selected bridge design. Keep `BrokerFillIdentity` separate from manual `BrokerTradeRecord` unless a reviewed Phase 3 design explicitly authorizes a narrow bridge.
- Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` repository remains untouched. Phase 2 remains closed.
- This checkpoint describes the verified code commit above. The documentation synchronization commit will trigger its own CI; do not treat that documentation commit as green until its exact-head run passes. Older checkpoint entries below are historical audit trail, not current status.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current verified checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Last verified code/test checkpoint:** `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f`; exact-head backend CI [run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386) passed **472 tests, 1 warning**, broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- **Last verified documentation checkpoint before this status refresh:** `391dfefc9580abf9537ee659877578033baae4fd`; exact-head backend CI [run 39568264419](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39568264419) passed.
- The Phase 2 audit covers the dependency/port matrix, broker-fill workflow boundary, idempotency and rollback, reconciliation crash recovery, transaction-level lease fencing, slow persistence, 20 concurrent expiry-boundary renewal/reclaim races, and official Upstox current-day API semantics.
- Official Upstox V2 [order-book](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-order-book/) and [get-trades-for-day](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-history/) endpoints are current-day endpoints without documented pagination parameters. Historical trades use a separate [paginated API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-historical-trades/); it is not wired into the Phase 2 worker.
- **Phase 2 technical checklist is complete.** Before any Phase 3 work, require a passing exact-head CI run for the then-current `main` and explicit user approval; never infer a later commit is green from an earlier run.
- Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion and automatic scheduling remain disabled. The original `Tradepro` repository remains untouched.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current verified checkpoint — 21 October 2026

- **Verified code/test checkpoint:** `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f`; exact-head backend CI [run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386) passed **472 tests, 1 warning**, the broker-write boundary guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- **Previously verified documentation checkpoint:** `a2e639f61e2c50070deb26d1a9a0741545c9737d`; exact-head backend CI [run 39568011689](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39568011689) passed. This is historical evidence for that SHA; every new commit still requires its own exact-head CI.
- The slow-persistence/lease-race audit is complete: the PostgreSQL row-lock test proves reclaim waits while a fenced write transaction is open; `test_postgres_high_volume_expiry_races_never_resurrect_stale_lease` passed 20 concurrent expiry-boundary renewal/reclaim races. Expired owners cannot renew, and ownership generation/token advance is verified.
- Official Upstox V2 [order-book](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-order-book/) and [get-trades-for-day](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-history/) endpoints are current-day endpoints without documented pagination parameters. Historical trades use a separate [paginated API](https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-historical-trades/); it is not wired into the Phase 2 worker.
- Phase 2 technical audit and scope reconciliation are complete. Keep Phase 3 blocked until this final documentation commit's exact-head CI passes. Do not enable live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion or automatic scheduling. The original `Tradepro` repository remains untouched.

# Tradepro Improved — Roadmap and Release Gates

Last reviewed: 2026-10-21
Scope: this repository only. The original `Tradepro` repository must remain untouched.

## Historical checkpoint — formerly marked Current verified checkpoint

- User-approved live-order idempotency/reconciliation design is implemented partially for Phase 1: [LIVE_ORDER_IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION.md](LIVE_ORDER_IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION.md).
- Architecture, safeguards, README, audit, project instructions and progress tracker link to the design.
- Phase 1 records/repository/tests are on `main`; latest verified Phase 1 code checkpoint `dd36b48a92057ad50618f6f9941f908832c9cea3` passed [workflow 39048147046](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39048147046), **215 tests passed, 1 warning**. The Phase 2 normalization foundation is now on `main` at test commit `b37452210bf07ad03acee1495e0627fae1378582`; [workflow 39049395091](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39049395091) passed **247 tests, 1 warning**, including SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- The code checkpoint adds Phase 1 durable storage/repository safeguards and tests only. It does not implement live submission or reconciliation, does not run a production migration and does not prove live trading readiness.

## Status summary

| Workstream | Status | Evidence / next gate |
|---|---|---|
| Paper execution and existing safeguards | Existing functionality; preserve | Keep regression tests proving paper path cannot call live broker placement |
| Instrument-master snapshot validation | Implemented and regression-tested; operational sync was disposable/in-memory | Repeat verified staging sync before deployment; never mutate production from an incomplete snapshot |
| Upstox V3 WebSocket authorization/reconnect protections | Partial implementation and unit/regression coverage | Real authorized session test remains open; shared stream state across workers remains open |
| Portfolio-wide risk controls | Existing configurable controls, still require deployment-aware review | Confirm atomic reservations, exposure semantics and user-adjustable thresholds; don't represent cost-basis/realized-loss checks as mark-to-market broker margin |
| Durable live-order idempotency | Phase 1 partially implemented; CI green for latest code checkpoint | Add concurrency/race tests and cross-database migration review; no broker submission |
| Broker order/trade reconciliation | Phase 2 read-only worker + durable run summaries + deduplicated manual-review issue records implemented and CI-tested; operator UI/API and real-account verification remain gated | Worker uses only the fixed-path GET-only Upstox client, user-scoped connection/token validation, lease, bounded retry, idempotent fill/status repositories and count-only durable run summaries. No write endpoint, scheduler, live submission or accounting updates. |
| Live submission orchestration | Not implemented / disabled | Sandbox-only workflow after prior phases pass |
| Production deployment verification | Incomplete | Backup-restored staging migration against actual DB engine, rollback/restore drill and operational runbook |

## Ordered roadmap

### Gate 0 — Design review (complete — user approved 2026-10-17)
- Read [PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), [LIVE_TRADING_SAFEGUARDS.md](LIVE_TRADING_SAFEGUARDS.md), [AUDIT_REPORT.md](AUDIT_REPORT.md), and [LIVE_ORDER_IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION.md](LIVE_ORDER_IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION.md).
- Confirm order-field canonicalization, supported Upstox products/order varieties, broker tag limits, order-history/trade API semantics and status mapping against current official docs.
- User explicitly approved `LIVE_ORDER_IDEMPOTENCY_RECONCILIATION.md`; approval is recorded in `PROGRESS.md`. This authorizes Phase 1 durable storage/repository safeguards only, not live-order submission.

### Gate 1 — Durable records only (no broker POST) — in progress
- [x] Additive SQLAlchemy records and Alembic migration for live intents, audit events, dispatch/outbox and broker-fill identities.
- [x] Unique idempotency key scoped to user/broker connection, canonical JSON payload hash, same-key/same-payload reuse and same-key/different-payload conflict.
- [x] Transactionally persist intent + initial event + outbox; enforce portfolio and broker-connection ownership in the repository.
- [x] Focused repository tests and clean SQLite Alembic migration run passed in GitHub Actions: [run 39043177545](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39043177545), 210 tests passed, 1 warning.
- [x] Add rollback atomicity test and a deterministic independent-session simulation of a competing unique-key winner; repository recovery returns the committed winner.
- [x] Validate order snapshots and audit event details as finite JSON and reject credential-like keys (nested access/refresh tokens, secrets, passwords, API keys, authorization headers and cookies); regression tests pass.
- [x] Add simultaneous same-key creation coverage using two independent PostgreSQL sessions and a barrier that forces both requests past an initial empty lookup; [workflow 39048147046](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39048147046) passed.
- [x] CI verifies clean SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 upgrade → downgrade of revision `202610170002` → re-upgrade: [run 39048147046](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39048147046).
- [ ] Verify upgrade/downgrade and constraints against a backup-restored staging copy of the actual deployment DB engine. No production migration has run.
- Scope boundary: no worker, API route or code path submits/cancels/reconciles broker orders in this phase.

### Gate 2 — Reconciliation-only workflow — repository foundation implemented; broker integration remains open
- [x] Add pure normalization for documented Upstox order book/details/history statuses and required fields; preserve raw status and route unknown/inconsistent records to review. Tested in [run 39049395091](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39049395091).
- [x] Add pure strict intent matcher: scope candidates to the authenticated broker connection, prefer an existing broker order ID, otherwise require one exact broker tag and exact instrument/side/type/quantity/product plus applicable price fields. Multiple candidates, cross-connection candidates, economic mismatches and unknown/contradictory broker states are not auto-linked. Tests passed in [run 39050424898](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39050424898).
- [x] Add repository-only status transition persistence with an allowlist of state transitions, optimistic version/state compare-and-set, broker-order-ID uniqueness handling, atomic audit event, credential-field validation and idempotent same-state no-op. [Run 39050941218](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39050941218) passed 261 tests, 1 warning, plus SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migrations.
- [x] Add pure Upstox per-order trade normalizer using documented `trade_id`, `order_id`, `instrument_token`, `transaction_type`, `quantity`, `average_price` and `exchange_timestamp`; unknown/malformed fields are rejected. [Run 39052075052](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39052075052).
- [x] Add repository-only `record_broker_fill()` keyed by broker connection + stable trade ID; atomically persist fill and linked intent audit event; identical replays are no-ops, conflicting replays fail closed, and cross-connection intent linking is rejected. [Run 39052203329](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39052203329) passed 274 tests.
- [x] Validate each linked fill against the already broker-ID-linked intent: instrument, side, order type, product, positive integer requested quantity, per-fill/aggregate quantity ceilings, and limit/stop-limit price protection. Reject fills before persistence when any check fails. [Run 39052939770](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39052939770) passed 279 tests, 1 warning, plus SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks.
- [x] Validate linked fills against the intent snapshot (instrument/side/product/type, linked broker order ID, integer order quantity, aggregate quantity ceiling and limit-price protection); safely link previously unmatched fills later after revalidation. [Run 39053352921](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39053352921) passed 281 tests, 1 warning.
- [x] Reconcile out-of-order status/fill observations against persisted fill evidence. Stale active states cannot erase partial/full trade evidence; partial fills plus cancellation are represented as `PARTIALLY_FILLED_CANCELLED`; conflicting full/partial or reject/fill evidence is quarantined as `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED`. [Run 39056392873](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39056392873) passed 294 tests, 1 warning, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks.
- [x] Implement the read-only worker in `backend/app/services/live_order_reconciliation_worker.py`: validates user-owned Upstox connection and usable token, claims/renews/completes the per-connection lease, uses only the GET-only client, applies bounded retry, normalizes daily trades and order-book records, strictly matches intents, persists unmatched fill identities, links verified fills, resolves state against trade evidence, and returns safe summary counts. No worker schedule/API trigger is wired, and CI uses mocks only.
- Remaining: add durable operator-facing run summaries/manual-review queue, confirm order/trade pagination and session/day boundaries against current official API responses, cover sliced orders, and plan a read-only sandbox verification. Current worker rejects invalid envelopes, stops on token/permission errors, retries bounded transient failures, and records unmatched fills without linking. It does not calculate positions or update local Order/Execution rows.
- No order-placement call in this phase.

### Gate 3 — Disabled sandbox submission workflow
- Transactionally persist intent, risk decision, audit and outbox before network I/O.
- Unknown submission after timeout/crash is reconciled; never blindly retry an ambiguous POST.
- Test crashes before/after broker acceptance, concurrent workers, rate limits, token expiry, rejection and cancellation races with mocks/sandbox only.
- Global live-submit switch stays hard-disabled in deployed configuration.

### Gate 4 — Operational readiness
- Verify account kill switch, portfolio risk recheck/reservation, alerts, safe audit redaction, monitoring, backup/restore, migration rollback and incident runbook.
- Verify real authenticated market-data stream separately; stream verification is not order-path certification.
- Resolve process-local WebSocket state before using multiple API workers.

### Gate 5 — Explicit controlled release
- Requires successful prior gates, official API contract verification, broker/account configuration, applicable compliance review and explicit user authorization.
- Start with a limited manually confirmed pilot and low risk limits. No autonomous live rollout by default.

## Completion/reporting rules

- After every meaningful change, update `PROGRESS.md`; update `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` and safeguards when the verified behavior or safety boundary changes.
- Commit changes to `tradepro-improved` and verify the exact commit SHA and GitHub Actions result. A successful older workflow does not validate a newer commit.
- Distinguish implemented, unit-tested, sandbox-tested, staging-verified and production-verified states. Never claim a real Upstox session or order test without evidence.
- Keep live trading disabled until all release gates and explicit authorization are complete.


### Read-only reconciliation client — implementation started
- [x] Added `backend/app/brokers/upstox/reconciliation_client.py`, a narrow fixed-path GET-only client for order book, order details, order history by order ID/tag, and per-order trades. It exposes no place/modify/cancel methods and classifies 401/403/429/5xx/network/timeout/non-JSON errors without returning response bodies.
- [x] Added contract tests for documented endpoints, query parameters, missing token, sanitized failures and absence of write methods. [Run 39056868434](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39056868434) passed **309 tests, 1 warning**; SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passed.
- [x] Implement worker orchestration, token/connection validation, bounded retries, job lease, order matching, fill import and safe in-memory summary counts. Verified with mocked worker tests; the code can make read-only GET calls only when explicitly invoked with a valid user-owned connection. It is not scheduled or wired into an API route.


### Worker lease foundation — implementation checkpoint
- [x] Added `LiveReconciliationLease` schema and reversible Alembic revision `202610170003` for one lease per broker connection.
- [x] Added `LiveReconciliationLeaseRepository` with bounded lease durations, atomic claims, expiry/reclaim, lease renewal, ownership checks and token-guarded completion. A stale worker cannot complete a newer worker's lease.
- [x] Added lease tests for contention, expiry/reclaim, stale-owner completion, renewal, cross-user ownership and invalid lease duration. [Run 39057273255](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39057273255) passed 318 tests, 1 warning; SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade passed.
- [x] Connect the lease to the read-only worker orchestration and add a PostgreSQL concurrency test proving only one simultaneous claim succeeds. [Lease concurrency test commit](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/bf0c2b707aaa023a961f899502ed9f2ae4d265a4).
- [x] Verify official API day-window semantics and document pagination boundaries; persistent run summaries and manual-review visibility are implemented. Official order-book and get-trades-for-day endpoints are current-day, with no documented pagination parameters. Historical trades use a separate paginated API that is not wired into this worker. No live/sandbox request was made.


### Latest Phase 2 worker verification — 2026-10-17
- Worker implementation: [`live_order_reconciliation_worker.py`](backend/app/services/live_order_reconciliation_worker.py), commit [`4ee8427`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/4ee8427f890f7c31021e30f7b36177e2f3f227c3). It is GET-only by dependency construction and is not automatically scheduled or wired to an API route.
- Regression coverage now includes successful matching/fill linking, repeat-run deduplication, cross-user rejection, busy lease, missing token, no mutation when either read fails, bounded transient retry and Retry-After, 403 no-retry, malformed envelope/data rejection, and UNKNOWN execution status recovery when later trade evidence arrives.
- Latest code test run [39058734080](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39058734080) passed **338 tests, 1 warning**; SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks passed. No live Upstox request, order action, production migration or accounting update occurred.
- Historical Phase 2 status superseded: current-day API/session boundary has been checked against official Upstox documentation; see the current checkpoint at the top of this file. Historical-trade retrieval remains separate future work, not part of this worker's current-day contract.


### Durable reconciliation run summary checkpoint — 2026-10-17
- Added `LiveReconciliationRun`, migration `202610170004`, and `LiveReconciliationRunRepository`; worker now persists a count-only summary and sanitized status/error category for each leased run.
- Test commit [`0e69fb2`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/0e69fb2efea692f2f675604ef3312cb1954ecc39) passed [run 39059271937](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39059271937): **340 passed, 1 warning**, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks.
- The run summary contains only known non-negative counters; no broker payload, token, header or exception text is stored. A run left in `RUNNING` after process crash is visible as incomplete, but automatic stale-run recovery and operator review UI remain future work.


### Durable manual-review issue checkpoint — 2026-10-17
- Added `LiveReconciliationIssue`, migration `202610170005`, and `LiveReconciliationIssueRepository`; the worker records safe, deduplicated issues for unmatched orders, malformed order/trade rows, trade persistence conflicts, fill-link conflicts and status-transition conflicts.
- Exact latest code commit [`71b5668`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/71b5668533f0461c12374319e496665cbda7e61c) passed [run 39059749652](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39059749652): **342 passed, 1 warning**, plus SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migrations. An earlier run failed because normalization errors were caught by the persistence-conflict branch; that was fixed by separating normalization from persistence, and the latest exact commit is green.
- Historical checkpoint superseded: run summaries and safe review issues are exposed through owner-scoped read API/UI; stale-run recovery and crash-boundary tests are covered. A privileged issue-resolution workflow and historical-trade API integration remain separate future work. No real broker request/order action or accounting update occurred.


### Owner-scoped reconciliation read API checkpoint — 2026-10-17
- Added run and issue list endpoints, typed response schemas and a query repository; queries always scope by authenticated `user_id`, with optional connection/status/type filters and a hard maximum limit of 100.
- Added HTTP tests for unauthenticated rejection, cross-user isolation, connection filtering, status filtering, invalid status/limit and safe response fields. Exact code commit [`f65b4ba`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/f65b4ba20ce9a1dacfe40580d8042cd98f36c19f) passed [run 39060230705](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39060230705): **345 passed, 1 warning**, plus SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migrations.
- The API is read-only: no issue resolution, run trigger, broker call or order action is exposed. Frontend UI and historical trade window support remain open.


### Reconciliation review UI checkpoint — 2026-10-17
- Added `frontend/app/reconciliation/page.tsx` and dashboard navigation link. The page lists recent safe run summaries and issues from the authenticated read API, supports issue-status filtering and manual refresh, and exposes no action to trigger reconciliation or resolve an issue.
- Exact commit [`e4343dc`](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/e4343dcb225c1f332b6c89399694d0a29a5df739) passed [frontend checks](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39060564743) and [backend CI](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39060564787): TypeScript/Next.js build succeeded; **345 backend tests passed, 1 warning**, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passed.
- Remaining: issue-resolution workflow, stale-run recovery, crash-boundary tests and historical trade window/pagination support. No live broker request or order action occurred.


## Reference-repository audit — 2026-10-20

See [REFERENCE_REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md](REFERENCE_REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md) for the source-level comparison and integration priorities.

### Current priority gate — updated 2026-10-20

1. The recovered live-fill accounting files and supporting model/schema dependencies are present again. Revisions `202610180006` → `202610180007` → `202610180008` now form a valid chain after `202610170005`.
2. Code/test checkpoint [run 39475387511](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39475387511) passed **355 tests, 1 warning**, including SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 upgrade → downgrade → re-upgrade checks.
3. This does not make live-fill accounting end-to-end complete: service is deliberately unregistered; ingestion, worker integration, shared live order/status accounting and real-account reconciliation remain outstanding.
4. Next: continue Phase 2 reconciliation release gates and crash/recovery/fill-linkage checks. Integrate the service only through a separately reviewed and tested path.
5. Live order submission remains disabled; no real orders for testing. All work stays in `tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains untouched. Do not delete the recovered files without explicit user approval.


## Safety-branch port checkpoint — 2026-10-21

- Main code/test checkpoint `3f210e592c8aa2e643e536a04f186da8187bc06b`; [CI run 39480002328](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39480002328) passed **431 tests, 1 warning**, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks passing.
- Ported pure Upstox response parsing and isolated broker trade staging with tests. Staging rejects missing exchange timestamps and does not update executions, positions, portfolio cash, or local order status.
- See [`SAFETY_BRANCH_PORT_MATRIX.md`](SAFETY_BRANCH_PORT_MATRIX.md) for 21 safety-only test modules and dependency/port decisions. Branch test counts are not directly comparable because source and test trees differ.
- Next: audit and test child-order reconciliation/partial-fill aggregation; keep fill promotion and broker writes disabled until transaction, idempotency, recovery, and account-isolation gates pass.


## Cumulative fill-accounting guard — 2026-10-21

- Added aggregate per-child cap in `LiveFillAccountingService`: previously accounted executions plus the new trade cannot exceed the broker-confirmed child filled quantity.
- Added regression test for two distinct trade IDs attempting to overrun the same child fill total. Exact-head [run 39480669799](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39480669799) passed **432 tests, 1 warning**, with SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passing.
- Next architecture gate: reconcile the worker's `BrokerFillIdentity` intake with the staging/accounting path's `BrokerTradeRecord`; do not dual-write or connect them until idempotency and transaction boundaries are explicit.


## Child-order reconciliation port — 2026-10-21

- Ported child-order status/fill reconciliation with current-main schema compatibility. It validates the broker snapshot against durable staged trade quantities and weighted average price, locks the child row, rejects fill regressions/terminal-state conflicts, and updates only child status/fill quantity.
- Exact-head [run 39481385581](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39481385581) passed **438 tests, 1 warning**, including SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 reversible migration checks.
- Remaining architecture gate: distinguish the intent-based `BrokerFillIdentity` workflow from the manual Order `BrokerTradeRecord`/`BrokerOrder` workflow, or design an explicit transaction-safe bridge. No live order submission or automatic accounting promotion is enabled.


## Phase 2 resume point — 2026-10-21

Latest main-branch checkpoint is `0ce59a7965e3e96a425fa8ae30c841eb0cb755bc`; exact-head [CI run 39552821228](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39552821228) passed 461 backend tests, the broker-write guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles. Phase 2 now covers stale-run recovery, incomplete-summary UI warning, inconsistent lease-state rejection, and eventual recovery after lease-release/summary-persistence crash. Next: review transaction atomicity between lease completion and run-summary finish and add lost-lease/ordering tests. Keep live submission and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Phase 2 resume point — 2026-10-21

Latest verified code/test HEAD `8f967adaa2328f16a0a08a104c3ec394e62f9310`; exact-head [CI run 39553655005](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39553655005) passed 463 backend tests, the broker-write guard, and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration cycles. Terminal run-summary persistence and lease release are now atomic; stale owners are marked `LEASE_LOST` without releasing a newer owner's lease. Next: audit cancellation, unexpected exceptions, and lease renewal/expiry concurrency. Keep live submission and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Phase 2 resume point — 2026-10-21

Historical checkpoint superseded by the lease-race audit: code/test HEAD `00ee9bad0e962d92244da6f63da1e46ba058ad6f` passed 472 tests, source guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks in [run 39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386). Large-batch expiry and renewal races are now covered. Keep live submission and automatic accounting promotion disabled.


## Phase 2 resume point — 2026-10-21

Historical checkpoint superseded: renewal remains every five records; UI marks `LEASE_LOST` and `WORKER_INTERRUPTED` summaries incomplete. Slow-record/high-volume expiry races and transaction-level fencing were subsequently audited and passed in CI run [39567242386](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39567242386). Keep live submission/accounting promotion disabled.


## Phase 3 live-fill accounting checkpoint — 2026-10-21

- Latest reviewed code HEAD at this checkpoint: `ef60ec93d39543c644dfd557f6f73b48ab793b60`.
- Exact-head [Backend CI run 39609474410](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39609474410) completed successfully: **485 passed, 1 warning in 30.25s**; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- The one warning is non-failing; CI logs also report GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation notices.
- Existing safeguards cover replay identity/charge validation, broker-confirmed fill quantities, cumulative child/order quantity limits, rejected-order protection, and atomic live-position/execution updates. This CI result verifies the current HEAD, not completion of all Phase 3 requirements.
- **Open Phase 3 requirement:** define and test the fee-allocation contract when a broker contract-note charge total covers multiple fills. The current API accepts a per-promotion breakdown and validates that its total equals its six components; it does not itself establish how a multi-fill contract-note total is allocated. Do not claim this issue resolved or wire in a coordinator/identity bridge until the rule is designed and regression-tested.
- Safety constraints unchanged: do not enable live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, or automatic scheduling; keep `BrokerFillIdentity` and `BrokerTradeRecord` separate pending a reviewed bridge design. Phase 2 remains closed.


## Phase 3 checkpoint refresh — 2026-10-21

- **Repository boundary:** all current Phase 3 work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, branch `main`. The original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` is a protected baseline and must not be modified.
- **Current HEAD at audit start:** `3b5c8831d4f3475eee320176b3c06bdbd5364bd2` (source-ledger design-gate documentation). The documentation synchronization commit created after this note requires its own exact-HEAD CI result.
- **Latest confirmed backend CI during this audit:** [run 39618611385](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39618611385) completed successfully on **commit `49f95bdd5f20ee99b21a573087c6e97a9bc03526`**, with **485 passed, 1 warning in 30.65s**. The broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade steps passed. This run is an older SHA, not current HEAD; do not label later commits green based on it.
- **Phase 3 status:** in progress. Current blocker is verified actual-charge evidence and an approved allocation basis. Reviewed Upstox documented APIs provide trade data, aggregate charges, or estimates, but no verified per-fill actual-charge source/contract-note ingestion capability was found in the reviewed adapter/API catalogue. Do not treat estimates as actual charges or allocate aggregate totals by guess.
- **Next engineering sequence:** establish authoritative source format and retention/security boundary; then implement immutable source evidence and per-fill allocation records, migration, transactional reconciliation/idempotency, and required regression tests; finally verify exact-HEAD CI.
- **Safety:** live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled. Phase 2 remains closed. This checkpoint is status tracking, not a claim that Phase 3 charge allocation is implemented.

## Latest Phase 3 continuation checkpoint — 2026-10-21

- Current reviewed repository HEAD at checkpoint start: 03b8e73cb918ab22e8c2a3857b77108c4a157942. This file's update will create a newer documentation-only commit.
- Re-inspected backend/tests/test_live_fill_accounting_service.py and backend/app/services/live_fill_accounting_service.py. The parametrized regression test includes ESTIMATED, AGGREGATE_CHARGES, TRADE_CHARGES_API and BROKER_ESTIMATE and asserts rejection before Execution/LivePosition writes. The service only accepts the literal source BROKER_REPORTED and validates reference presence/length, paise precision, non-negative components and total equality.
- Important limitation: the source string and reference are caller-supplied; this validation is not cryptographic/source provenance. No real per-fill actual-charge evidence path has been verified, so an arbitrary caller can still mislabel a source. This is not fixed by the negative-source tests.
- Exact-HEAD CI: not verified. The GitHub connector's workflow-run wrapper filters to pull-request-triggered runs; direct workflow-run endpoint access was rejected by the connector, so prior empty results cannot establish that no push run exists. Do not claim CI success or failure from these empty results. Inspect the actual Actions page/run for the newest SHA before marking green.
- Do not add a production importer, allocation formula, or schema migration until authoritative evidence defines the file structure and component-specific allocation basis. Continue with provenance design only where it can be made correct without assuming unknown broker fields.
- Safety and scope unchanged: all changes belong only in tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; original Tradepro is protected. Phase 2 remains closed. Live broker submission, automatic accounting promotion, and automatic scheduling remain disabled.

## Phase 3 source-document access and integrity audit — 22 October 2026

- Audited the existing `BrokerChargeEvidence` model and `require_reviewed_charge_evidence` service on `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. The model persists filename, SHA-256, byte size, parser-version metadata, report reference, and review provenance, but explicitly stores the original document outside the table.
- No broker-contract-note-specific upload/retrieval endpoint or storage adapter was found in the audited application entrypoint, API route locations, service paths, and configuration. This is a scoped audit finding, not proof that no generic file handling exists elsewhere.
- The current evidence validator checks evidence identity/connection, source kind, reviewed status, reviewer identity/timestamp, and report reference. It does not retrieve the original bytes, recompute SHA-256/byte size, or parse an authoritative charge-component total.
- **Step 1 remains in progress; no source-storage implementation is claimed.** Before implementation, define a private, persistent, non-web-served storage boundary and a stable evidence-ID-to-object mapping. Retrieval must enforce authorization, prevent path traversal, verify the exact byte count and SHA-256 before parsing, and fail closed on missing/changed content. Do not treat a matching hash alone as proof of broker authenticity.
- Next implementation should add a configurable storage adapter and durable object key tied to the evidence record, then authenticated upload/retrieval and integrity tests. Choose the deployment-backed persistent volume only after confirming the Docker/VM volume layout; do not silently store source documents in an ephemeral container filesystem or Git.
- The prior successful PR-head CI run applies to its exact tested commit only; documentation updates require a fresh CI run on the resulting exact head. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.

## Phase 3 private contract-note storage implementation — 22 October 2026

- Added configurable `BROKER_CHARGE_DOCUMENT_ROOT` (default `/var/lib/tradepro/contract-notes`) and a named Docker volume mounted only into backend and worker containers, not Nginx/frontend.
- Added authenticated upload/download endpoints under `/api/v1/broker-charge-evidence`. Upload requires ownership of the broker connection, limits files to 10 MiB, uses an application-generated UUID key, records SHA-256, byte size, and uploader identity (`received_by_user_id`), and leaves evidence in `RECEIVED`; it never auto-reviews or promotes accounting.
- Added atomic private file storage and integrity-checked retrieval. Opaque keys reject path traversal; missing/modified content fails closed. Added storage-service tests for round-trip, tampering, missing documents, invalid keys, empty input, and deletion, plus API tests for owner-scoped upload/download and tamper rejection.
- Alembic revision `202610220011` adds nullable `storage_key` for legacy evidence compatibility. **Exact-head CI and SQLite/PostgreSQL migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks remain required.**
- SHA-256 proves byte continuity with the recorded upload, not broker-origin authenticity. Independent source-component parsing/review, persisted component provenance, exact fill-set/amount/currency/rounding reconciliation, and atomic promotion remain later Phase 3 gates.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. Work remains exclusively in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 durable source-component provenance — 22 October 2026

- Added `BrokerChargeSourceComponent` and Alembic revision `202610220012` to persist a charge component's evidence ID, exact source SHA-256, component name, INR amount, source page/row locator, extraction method, parser-version field, extracting user, status, reviewer, review timestamp, and review note.
- This first workflow is explicitly **manual transcription**, versioned as `manual-transcription-v1`; it does not claim that a broker-specific parser exists or that the amount was machine-extracted. No PDF/CSV parser or broker document format was assumed.
- Added authenticated endpoints to record a component as `PENDING_REVIEW`, verify the original file's stored fingerprint/size before recording or reviewing, and require a distinct platform administrator (the existing `is_admin` role) to confirm the amount against the original source before it becomes `VERIFIED`. Rejected components remain rejected; duplicate component entries and non-INR currencies fail closed.
- Added API regression tests for pending-before-review behavior, same-user review rejection, distinct-reviewer verification, tampered-source rejection, invalid currency, and duplicate component prevention.
- CI run [39742979087](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39742979087) passed on code head `c1004fb5718592fb76ccf50c4007a0d8aec11fb7`: 542 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed. **This documentation synchronization creates a newer head, so recheck exact-head CI before merge.** This is source-component provenance, not the final reconciliation gate: allocation totals must still match verified source components, exact eligible fill sets, currency, and rounding policy under a transaction before any future promotion is considered.
- PR #6 stays draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. All changes target `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, never original `Tradepro`.

## Phase 3 allocation-ledger verification — 22 October 2026

- Added `verify_component_allocation_ledger` as a fail-closed verifier for a reviewed source component and its allocation rows. It rechecks the stored document fingerprint/size and validates component/evidence review provenance.
- Source-component review persists the canonical sorted eligible trade-record UUID set, its SHA-256 manifest fingerprint, the approved `largest-remainder-v1` method, and the reviewer-approved allocation basis. The reviewer must identify persisted fills from the same broker connection; duplicate/missing/cross-connection IDs are rejected.
- Verification requires the allocation ledger's exact fill set to equal the reviewed manifest, every source total to equal the independently reviewed component amount, currency/method/basis to match, and the paise-exact allocated sum to equal the source amount. Evidence, component, allocation rows, and fills are locked during verification.
- Transactional promotion is implemented in `promote_verified_component_allocations` in `broker_charge_allocation_reconciliation_service.py`. It calls the verifier while holding the transaction locks, requires the authorized source-component reviewer, promotes the entire eligible set to `RECONCILED` with a deterministic durable reference, and supports exact idempotent replay. It uses a savepoint and does not commit the caller's outer transaction; callers must commit only with the enclosing accounting operation. It is service-only, not exposed as a public API endpoint.
- Mismatched source bytes, provenance, fill set, amount, currency, method, basis, mixed/rejected statuses, or stale references fail closed; the full set remains pending or the transaction rolls back. No partial promotion is allowed.
- Tests cover exact verification, fill-set/source-total/tampered-source failures, successful atomic promotion, idempotent replay, wrong-reviewer rejection, and outer-transaction rollback. CI run [39745393196](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39745393196) passed on code head `007c41796da7413823a98f92360d93af074ab88e`: **549 tests passed, 1 warning**; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- CI run [39745820117](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39745820117) passed on exact head `5139146d48cb3f5906db77014a93b5d20ead3146`: 549 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips passed. This is a historical exact-head checkpoint; every later code or documentation commit must receive its own exact-head CI verification before merge. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled.

## Phase 3 transactional allocation promotion — 22 October 2026

- Added `promote_verified_component_allocations` as an internal service (not an API endpoint). It re-runs the source-document, review-provenance, exact fill-set, amount, INR currency, rounding-method, approved-basis, and total checks while locking the relevant evidence, component, allocation, and trade rows.
- Promotion sets the complete eligible allocation set to `RECONCILED` and writes a deterministic durable reference tying the component UUID, source SHA-256, and eligible-fill-set SHA-256. It rejects mixed, rejected, stale-reference, incomplete, or mismatched sets.
- The operation runs inside a savepoint and **never commits the caller's transaction**. The caller must commit only after the whole enclosing transaction succeeds. A repeated exact promotion is idempotent; tests cover successful promotion, replay, unauthorized actor rejection, and outer-transaction rollback.
- This internal service is not wired to an automatic accounting path or exposed as an API endpoint. Live broker submission remains disabled; the service does not itself create accounting entries or send orders.
- CI run [39745393196](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39745393196) passed on promotion-code head `007c41796da7413823a98f92360d93af074ab88e`: 549 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips passed. Step 4 code is verified at that head; any subsequent code or documentation commits require another exact-head CI check before merge. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and all changes remain exclusively in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.

## Phase 3 final audit follow-up — 22 October 2026

- Preserved rejected source-component history: each evidence/component pair now uses a positive revision number; a new transcription is allowed only after prior revisions for that component are rejected. Pending or verified duplicates remain blocked, and the unique evidence/component/revision constraint protects concurrent attempts.
- Promotion now rechecks that the recorded reviewer is still an active platform administrator at promotion time, in addition to matching the reviewed component identity. Loss of authorization fails closed and leaves allocations pending.
- Exact-head CI run [39746382703](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39746382703) passed on `6870fdc8a0bee91f486a250351eac1beb7edbf3d`: 551 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed. Any later commit requires a fresh exact-head CI check before merge.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled, and allocation promotion is still an internal transaction-owned service rather than a public API endpoint.


## Phase 3 exact-head verification checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Current reviewed PR head at checkpoint start: `2d524632a98167e360be249a5bf255a55cae6daf` on `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation` in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39746755812](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39746755812) completed successfully: 551 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip checks passed. This supersedes earlier notes in this document that described this commit's CI as pending.
- The PostgreSQL concurrency test exists at `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`; it requires CI's dedicated `TEST_POSTGRES_URL`. The previous documented successful PostgreSQL race run is still a separate earlier commit; confirm the current run's test job environment/logs before claiming this exact run exercised the race test.
- Document storage writes atomically to a private file and verifies SHA-256 and byte count on retrieval. Deployment backup/restore and cleanup of orphaned files remain operational follow-ups; code-level storage tests do not prove production recovery procedures.
- Outstanding review gates: confirm the current CI run executed the PostgreSQL race test; review transaction/authorization behavior and accounting integration; verify deployment volume backup/restore; assess broker-source authenticity limitations. SHA-256 proves byte continuity against recorded evidence, not broker-origin authenticity.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending review and explicit approval. No live broker order submission or automatic accounting posting is enabled. Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.


## Follow-up: upload rollback cleanup and residual orphan risk — 22 October 2026

- Re-reviewed `backend/app/api/v1/broker_charge_evidence.py` at PR #6 branch `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. After writing the private document, the upload endpoint commits the evidence row; on `IntegrityError` or other caught exceptions it rolls back the database session and attempts `delete_document` for the generated storage key. This is an existing compensating cleanup path and should not be described as entirely absent.
- Residual risk remains: process termination between successful file write and database commit, or failure during the compensating delete, can leave an unreferenced object. Current tests prove basic storage/read integrity but do not demonstrate crash injection or production orphan reconciliation.
- Safe next improvement: add a read-only audit command/service that enumerates only validated 32-hex storage keys and compares them with database `storage_key` values; report missing referenced files, mismatched hashes/sizes, and unreferenced files without deleting anything. Cleanup should be a separate explicit, audited operation with age/grace-period checks and approval; never delete automatically during audit.
- Operational validation still required: coordinated backup and isolated restore of both PostgreSQL `postgres_data` and `broker_charge_documents`, then verify each restored evidence object's storage key, SHA-256, and byte size. Compose mounts confirm shared runtime volume wiring, not a backup guarantee.
- Last verified CI before this documentation follow-up: run [39747922164](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39747922164) passed for commit `f87dd096b2e2f4044b1eb67fa63e277bceb136c9`; rerun and verify CI after the final documentation commit before treating this checkpoint as closed.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending final review and explicit approval. SHA-256 verifies byte continuity against recorded metadata, not broker-origin authenticity. No automatic accounting posting or live broker order submission is enabled. Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.


## Read-only contract-note storage audit checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Implemented `audit_contract_note_storage` in `backend/app/services/broker_charge_document_storage_service.py`. It compares evidence rows to files in the configured storage root and reports missing files, size/SHA-256 mismatches, invalid storage keys, duplicate database keys, and unreferenced opaque-key files. The audit is read-only and never deletes files.
- Added regression tests for a clean store and for missing, tampered, and unreferenced files. Exact-head CI run [39749195128](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39749195128) passed on commit `e7214e970b8e2fa3e966dc339141288a30154038`: **553 passed, 1 warning**; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks passed.
- The endpoint-level database-rollback plus cleanup-failure path is covered by a regression test. Still required: interrupted-process/crash recovery validation, an isolated coordinated PostgreSQL-plus-document-volume restore drill, and final accounting/idempotency review.
- Do not automatically delete orphaned files. Cleanup remains a separate approved, audited operation with grace-period safeguards. SHA-256 demonstrates byte continuity against recorded evidence, not broker-origin authenticity.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged pending final review and explicit approval. Live broker order submission remains disabled. Scope is `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `Tradepro`.


## Upload cleanup regression checkpoint — 22 October 2026

- Added a regression test for the contract-note cleanup helper when storage deletion raises `OSError`; the failure is logged and does not escape the helper, allowing the upload handler to preserve its original database exception.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run [39750696319](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39750696319) passed on commit `279ea3e6f170dc991c243b57372b86e86db065ee`: **554 passed, 1 warning**. Broker-write boundary guard and SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks passed.
- Upload-recovery coverage is now stronger: an endpoint-level regression test forces database commit failure plus compensating file-deletion failure, then verifies the orphan is reported by the read-only storage audit. This is a simulated integration test, not a production restore drill.
- Remaining gates: coordinated PostgreSQL + contract-note-volume restore drill; independently reviewed source-origin evidence; final allocation replay/idempotency and promotion transaction review; CI verification after the next documentation or code change.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled. Scope is `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` is not the target.


### Phase 3 checkpoint — 2026-10-22 (contract-note upload recovery integration)

- Added a real upload-endpoint regression test that forces the evidence database commit to fail after the source bytes are written, then forces compensating file deletion to fail. The test verifies the original database exception remains visible, no evidence row persists, and the read-only storage audit identifies the unreferenced opaque-key file without deleting it.
- CI run 39752136518 passed on test commit 5cfa76e14add51a34e6bc157ad328c74d9f2a33b: 555 passed, 1 warning; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration checks completed successfully.
- This validates the simulated endpoint/database/storage failure path; it is not a production-volume backup/restore drill and does not establish contract-note authenticity beyond recorded SHA-256/size continuity.
- Remaining gates: coordinated database plus document-volume backup/restore drill; final source-evidence, exact fill-set, currency/rounding, idempotency, and atomic-promotion review; synchronize this checkpoint across all nine documents and rerun CI on the final documentation commit.
- Scope/safety unchanged: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled.


### Phase 3 restore-drill gate

- Do not mark backup/restore complete based on Compose volume declarations or unit tests. In an isolated environment, take a consistent PostgreSQL backup and a matching snapshot/archive of the `broker_charge_documents` volume, restore both into an isolated stack, run the storage audit, verify representative evidence hashes/sizes and database-to-file references, then record the backup identifiers, timestamps, commands, results, and any missing/mismatched/unreferenced files. No production restore has been performed by this checkpoint.


### CI verification checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- Documentation commit `13a406891b286dd8077ee1430c1d62f3b6086309` passed GitHub Actions run `39753249388` for the backend pytest workflow. That run alone establishes the backend test result; do not attribute broker-write guard or SQLite/PostgreSQL migration checks to it without separate exact-commit job evidence.
- This CI result applies to that exact commit only. These documentation updates will create a new head and require a fresh CI result before being called verified.
- Production backup/restore remains unperformed. The required isolated drill must restore PostgreSQL and `broker_charge_documents` together, then validate source hashes/sizes and database/file references; do not infer restore success from CI or volume declarations.


### Exact-head CI scope correction — 2026-10-22

- Latest verified head before this note, `bb46a17dd8578ccce1858ed820584a4348c05e8f`, passed GitHub Actions run `39753596786`: **555 passed, 1 warning in 39.40s** in the Backend pytest job.
- The run queried for that SHA exposes only the Backend pytest job. Therefore this exact-head result does not independently establish the broker-write guard or SQLite/PostgreSQL migration round-trip checks; cite earlier runs for those only at their own SHAs.
- This note creates a new documentation head; verify CI on the resulting exact head before considering it fully checkpointed. The coordinated database + document-volume restore drill remains unperformed.


### Phase 3 backup/restore runbook checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- Added `docs/PHASE3_BACKUP_RESTORE_DRILL.md`, a step-by-step isolated procedure for paired PostgreSQL + `broker_charge_documents` backup, restore into a separate target, SHA-256 artifact verification, storage-audit acceptance, and recorded reviewer sign-off.
- The runbook is a procedure only. No actual coordinated backup/restore has been performed or claimed by this commit. Keep the worker stopped in the target until integrity checks pass; never restore over production or enable live broker orders for this drill.
- Latest prior documentation commit `8b3c87da67aea8d21cca8a6748b7d27b88a1878a` passed backend pytest in run `39754157399`. This new runbook and documentation checkpoint creates a new head and requires fresh CI verification.


### Phase 3 exact-head CI and acceptance checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- GitHub Actions run 39754635028 passed on PR head 17e9f9d220e504c2a522d8c98289c2765bf02dd2: backend pytest reported 555 passed, 1 warning in 39.64s; the broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip checks passed in this run's job logs. Verify the exact run if this branch advances.
- Accounting acceptance remains under review: code-level checks cover exact fill-set matching, deterministic paise-level largest-remainder allocation, conflict/replay rejection, PostgreSQL evidence-row serialization, and transactional promotion. This is not proof that real contract-note source amounts or production restore have been independently validated.
- The isolated coordinated PostgreSQL + broker_charge_documents restore drill has NOT been executed. Do not claim restore success. Restore into a separate target, verify artifact checksums, file sizes and SHA-256 fingerprints, database/file references and read-only storage audit, retain logs and reviewer sign-off, and keep workers/live broker writes disabled throughout.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged. All work is limited to tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; the original Tradepro repository is out of scope. Live broker order submission remains disabled.
- This documentation checkpoint creates a new commit/head and therefore requires CI verification on the resulting exact head before the checkpoint is considered fully verified.


### Exact-head CI completion — 2026-10-22

- GitHub Actions run 39755207327 completed successfully on commit 5744e8433a5a486938f6e2d6bed5b705ecaea869. Backend pytest passed; broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks all passed. See https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39755207327.
- This confirms that commit only. The following documentation checkpoint will create a new head and must itself receive fresh CI verification.
- Coordinated isolated restore drill remains unexecuted; do not claim recovery acceptance. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker submission remains disabled; original Tradepro remains out of scope.


### GitHub-only environment clarification and latest CI result — 2026-10-22

- User confirmed Tradepro Improved exists on GitHub only; do not assume a user-local Docker checkout/host. All project work remains restricted to tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; original Tradepro is out of scope.
- GitHub Actions run 39755480864 passed on commit 1d1533d70eca904e9650a813c671927475cacd36. Backend test suite, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite migration round-trip, and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trip all succeeded. Run: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39755480864.
- Restore drill is still NOT executed. Since no user-local environment should be assumed, the next recovery step must be provisioned as a disposable isolated CI/cloud environment or explicitly established as unavailable. Do not claim restore success absent captured execution evidence, checksums, storage audit, counts, and reviewer sign-off.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker order submission remains disabled. Any new commit requires its own exact-head CI verification.


### Synthetic restore CI coverage — 2026-10-22

- Added a GitHub Actions step to create a synthetic PostgreSQL evidence table and a synthetic opaque-key document, capture a PostgreSQL custom-format dump plus document archive, verify backup checksums, restore both into a separate temporary database/directory, and compare the restored file SHA-256/byte size and database metadata.
- The workflow retains the synthetic evidence bundle as artifact `synthetic-restore-drill-evidence` for 14 days, including checksum manifest, synthetic dump/archive, result record and expected/restored metadata. This is synthetic CI evidence only, not recovery evidence for real contract-note backups or production data.
- New workflow commits require exact-head CI to finish green before considering this automation validated. The actual coordinated restore drill using real retained backup artifacts remains outstanding; do not claim full recovery acceptance.
- Project is GitHub-only; do not assume a local Docker host. All work remains limited to tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; original Tradepro is out of scope. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and live broker order submission remains disabled.


### Latest synthetic restore workflow acceptance checkpoint — 2026-10-22

- GitHub Actions run 39756592781 completed with conclusion success on exact head 98b8260adf17fbee2d6cfe51fcd86175584334c4. Backend tests, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document archive restore, and evidence-retention step all passed. Run: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39756592781.
- GitHub retained artifact `synthetic-restore-drill-evidence` (artifact ID 12415978081, size 2208 bytes, SHA-256 digest `e2d18437b94a16b1b649ee94deaf81428d35406ab54a731bfef1750c7f360fe2`, expiry 2026-11-05). This confirms synthetic test evidence only; it is not proof of restoring actual retained contract-note backups. Artifact run: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39756592781.
- Accounting acceptance remains open pending independent verification of original contract-note source/component amounts, exact fill identities, paise-level totals, replay/conflict behavior and enclosing-transaction rollback/atomic promotion. The code review alone does not close those gates.
- No local Docker host is assumed; user confirmed Tradepro Improved is GitHub-only. A restore against real retained backup artifacts remains outstanding. All work stays in tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved; original Tradepro is out of scope. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and live broker order submission remains disabled.
- This checkpoint changes documentation and must receive fresh CI on the resulting exact head before it can be called CI-verified.

### Phase 3 source-to-ledger review follow-up — 2026-10-22

- Exact-head GitHub Actions run `39757964236` passed on commit `0c74960c9b0bb1590aa14ef709f55e691b3ac5e2`, covering backend pytest, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document restore, and evidence artifact retention.
- Code review confirms evidence-row serialization, broker-connection validation for target fills, conflicting replay rejection, and pending status until source-ledger verification/promotion.
- Source component values remain human-transcribed; CI fixtures are synthetic and cannot verify real contract-note amounts or real backup recovery. Both real-evidence acceptance gates remain open.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; live broker writes remain disabled; original `Tradepro` is out of scope. Do not treat this note as approval to merge or enable live trading.


## Phase 3 checkpoint — lock-order regression verified (22 October 2026)

- Latest exact-head CI run [39817017949](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39817017949) passed on commit `7809e8d7981a19625142dc73e689caa2976c97d6`: backend pytest **565 passed, 1 warning**.
- Live-fill accounting now defers target allocation-row locks until after source-component verification, refreshes target allocations under lock, and fails closed if their state changed. The regression test checks lock-order invariants rather than a brittle exact query prefix.
- A preceding implementation run failed on an outdated test expectation; the test was corrected and the latest run passed.
- PostgreSQL concurrency coverage exists for competing allocation requests on one evidence record. Concurrent source verification versus promotion, deadlock/retry handling, and conflicting fill-set replay still need further review.
- Real contract-note authenticity and a real retained Oracle Cloud database/document restore remain deferred until real evidence is available. Synthetic restore testing does not prove real-data recovery.
- PR #6 remains open/draft/unmerged pending review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled.
- Scope remains `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` only; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.


## 2026-10-23 — live-fill/ledger concurrency checkpoint

- Added PostgreSQL integration test `test_live_fill_promotion_races_with_component_ledger_verification` in `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py`.
- Commit: `66fda569b1e4879d270a970cb5b6d216c2f55f9c`; exact-head CI run `39923699033` passed: **570 passed, 1 warning in 30.89s**. Broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration checks, and synthetic database/document-volume restore drill passed.
- CI: https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39923699033
- Safety: only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` changed; PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and live broker order writes remain disabled.
- Limitation: fixtures and document bytes are synthetic; authentic Upstox contract-note validation and a real Oracle-host backup restore remain outstanding.


## Exact-head CI checkpoint — 2026-10-23

- Verified PR #6 head `f75471c5bc64bc9ede61c7dc621d1200e97fa078` with GitHub Actions run [39927004048](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39927004048): Backend pytest job completed successfully; broker-write boundary guard, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade checks, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill, and evidence-retention step all passed.
- This result applies to that exact PR head. Any documentation commit creates a new head and must receive its own CI verification before the checkpoint is considered current.
- Synthetic restore evidence is not proof of restoring the user's real Oracle Cloud database/document backup. Actual retained-backup restore and authenticated real broker-source validation remain separate acceptance items.
- The integrated concurrency test that races real `LiveFillAccountingService.promote_trade` with allocation-ledger verification/promotion remains an open Phase 3 acceptance gate; do not treat the accounting review as complete yet.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance-gate review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. All changes remain confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## Follow-up verification — 23 October 2026 (supersedes stale pending wording)

- Exact current head `3c592de0bb2262ec4753196dfba26d7a31c70986` passed GitHub Actions Backend tests in [run 39927573489](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39927573489). The job passed pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, and restore-evidence retention.
- Code inspection confirms `backend/tests/test_broker_charge_allocation_postgres_concurrency.py::test_live_fill_promotion_races_with_component_ledger_verification` exists. It races `LiveFillAccountingService.promote_trade` against `verify_component_allocation_ledger` using synthetic persisted evidence and asserts no errors, one inserted execution, one live position, and reconciled component allocations. The CI job passed this PostgreSQL-enabled integration suite.
- Therefore, earlier checkpoint text describing this exact integrated race test as still absent is superseded. Remaining Phase 3 acceptance is broader review of charge-component allocation policy and evidence provenance, source authenticity limits for public examples, plus separate real Oracle backup/restore validation; synthetic tests do not prove real-account authenticity or actual backup recovery.
- PR #6 remains draft/open/unmerged until all acceptance gates are reviewed and the user explicitly approves. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Scope remains only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains outside scope.


## Component-specific allocation policy review — 23 October 2026

- Added `PHASE3_COMPONENT_ALLOCATION_POLICY.md` documenting the key distinction between deterministic allocation arithmetic and a justified charge-specific attribution basis.
- Public references reviewed: [Upstox brokerage/charges](https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/), [Upstox brokerage calculator](https://upstox.com/calculator/brokerage-calculator/), [NSE levies/STT](https://www.nseindia.com/static/invest/first-time-investor-sebi-turnover-fees-stt-other-levies), and [NSE stamp duty](https://www.nseindia.com/static/invest/first-time-investor-stamp-duty-charges-taxes). Public tariff pages show effective-date and segment/product differences; rates must not be hardcoded as timeless or inferred from historical sample notes.
- Policy gap: the generic allocator's support for QUANTITY, NOTIONAL and EXPLICIT_REVIEWED is not blanket approval for those bases for every component. Brokerage/order caps, GST tax-base composition, buy-side-only stamp duty, side/product-specific STT and exchange charges, and account/scrip-level fees need component-appropriate rules and tests. The new policy file records the acceptance matrix and tests still required.
- Exact head before this policy-doc addition, `6d922d3436dcf2b3def7b5c77665056be173fab1`, passed Backend tests in [run 39928182307](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39928182307), including pytest, broker-write guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore/evidence retention. The new policy documentation commit and subsequent doc-sync commit(s) require their own exact-head CI before being marked verified.
- PR #6 remains draft/open/unmerged pending policy gates, full acceptance review and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` is out of scope.


## Fail-closed allocation gate — CI verified 23 October 2026

- Commit `2e14ce6feed8357a85813ec5924e577879b2e4ca` passed GitHub Actions [run 39929331878](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39929331878). Backend pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, evidence retention, and cleanup all completed successfully.
- The source-reconciliation verification gate now rejects `QUANTITY` and `NOTIONAL` allocation bases until component-specific effective-dated rules are approved. A regression test verifies unsupported notional allocation raises and rows remain `PENDING_RECONCILIATION`. Explicitly reviewed per-fill weights remain available, subject to existing provenance/reviewer/promotion checks.
- This is a conservative fail-closed safeguard, not completion of component-specific tariff automation. Still required: reviewed tests/rules for brokerage caps and multi-fill orders, GST taxable base, buy-side stamp duty, side/product-specific STT/CTT, exchange/segment charges and effective-date transitions. Ambiguous source scope must remain pending.
- Publicly shared Upstox contract-note examples are for layout/research only and are not independently authenticated. Actual Oracle Cloud backup recovery remains separate from synthetic restore CI.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged until acceptance gates are reviewed and the user explicitly approves. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Changes are confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## Phase 3 charge-calculation checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Verified code/test commit `b37e6cab7c9cbba0897e5c02161812d121ba2c7e` passed the full Backend pytest workflow: [run 39933579727](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39933579727). Steps passed included pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, evidence retention, and cleanup.
- The branch now has arithmetic helpers/regression coverage for brokerage caps, GST on an explicit taxable base, buyer-side stamp duty, STT/CTT on an explicit base, and exchange/SEBI charges on explicit bases. These are arithmetic helpers, not a verified tariff engine: they do not establish official effective-dated rates, applicability by exchange/segment/instrument/product/side, exemptions, or per-fill attribution.
- Latest exchange/SEBI test commit: `b37e6cab7c9cbba0897e5c02161812d121ba2c7e` (CI passed). Documentation checkpoint commit `1c3906551903acc0bb5a4450c7b8a56b3f9a659a` was created afterward; exact-head CI has not yet returned a workflow result.
- Remaining Phase 3 gates: source and version official effective-dated tariffs with provenance; model applicability and taxable/calculation bases; connect rule evaluation to durable per-fill allocations; test rounding, caps, effective-date transitions, replay/idempotency, and reconciliation; verify full CI on the final documentation/code head.
- Automatic `QUANTITY`/`NOTIONAL` allocation remains fail-closed until the relevant component-specific rules are reviewed and accepted. Do not promote ambiguous or unsupported charges.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. All changes are confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `Tradepro` repository is out of scope and must remain untouched.


## Exact-head documentation CI result — 23 October 2026

- Exact checkpoint commit `d0de363bd0b034582754b41de17ae991f6c043aa` passed GitHub Actions [run 39934671391](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39934671391). This verifies the nine-document checkpoint head at the time of the run.
- Resume from the `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation` branch in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`. Next work: obtain/record official Upstox and statutory charge-rule sources with effective dates and provenance; model applicability by exchange/segment/instrument/product/side; then implement and test tariff-driven durable per-fill allocation and reconciliation.
- Arithmetic helpers are groundwork only, not a verified tariff engine. Keep unknown/ambiguous allocation fail-closed. PR #6 stays draft and unmerged until acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Original `Tradepro` is outside scope and must remain untouched.


## Exact-head CI confirmation for saved checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- The nine-document checkpoint head `c2959ffed34f6dd1c299bdb36091b987df06c11a` passed full GitHub Actions run [39935827529](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39935827529). Verified steps: backend pytest, broker-write boundary enforcement, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 Alembic upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade, isolated synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore, evidence retention and cleanup.
- Resume work on `phase3/durable-per-fill-charge-allocation`. Next engineering task: verify and record current official Upstox, exchange and statutory charge rules with URLs, effective dates, applicability and provenance. Then implement tariff-driven component calculation and durable per-fill allocation, with regression tests for effective-date transitions, rounding, order caps, replay and reconciliation.
- Existing helpers for brokerage cap, GST, stamp duty, STT/CTT, exchange and SEBI charges are arithmetic groundwork only. They do not constitute a verified tariff engine. Keep unsupported/ambiguous scopes fail-closed.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Work only in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; the original `Tradepro` repository remains outside scope.


## Upstox charge-rule source register — 23 October 2026

- Added `docs/UPSTOX_CHARGE_RULE_SOURCE_REGISTER.md` at commit `de97bd3bfe90e82b888181cf109ed6a1b8e41d41`. It records the official Upstox brokerage pricing page, Brokerage Details API, Get Trades Charges API, and official contract-note guidance, with their limits and implementation requirements.
- Key source URLs: https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/ ; https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/ ; https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-charges/ ; https://upstox.com/help-center/how-can-i-access-and-download-the-contract-note-248457/ ; https://upstox.com/help-center/understanding-the-contract-note-248458/
- Research indicates the pricing page contains historical and current rate sections, including STT/CTT changes effective 1 April 2026 and NSE transaction-charge changes effective 1 March 2026. Therefore, do not hardcode a single timeless rate or use a rate from the wrong effective period. BSE scrip-group variation, commodity/currency segments, option premium/futures turnover, DP charges, GST base composition and per-crore unit normalization require explicit rules.
- The authenticated brokerage API can calculate supported orders from instrument, quantity, product, side and price; the trades-charges API provides a segment/financial-year breakdown. Treat the latter as aggregate reconciliation only, not per-fill evidence.
- Next: implement a versioned tariff-rule model with effective dates, explicit normalized units/bases, source provenance and review status; add applicability/rounding/effective-date regression tests before wiring rules into durable per-fill allocation. Unknown or ambiguous cases remain fail-closed.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Effective-dated tariff registry groundwork — 23 October 2026

- Added `docs/UPSTOX_CHARGE_RULE_SOURCE_REGISTER.md` (commit `de97bd3bfe90e82b888181cf109ed6a1b8e41d41`) documenting official Upstox pricing/API/contract-note sources, rate effective-date cautions, API limitations and the required provenance fields.
- Added `backend/app/services/broker_tariff_rules.py` (commit `0ec5590579c67c2575c8c4c72cf75bc56605120b`), a fail-closed rule selector requiring exact broker/exchange/segment/product/side/component/basis match, an effective date, source URL and SHA-256-shaped provenance, and APPROVED status. It rejects missing and overlapping rules and intentionally ships without active rates.
- Added `backend/tests/test_broker_tariff_rules.py` (commit `74240f2cc0af05befeee1fa97f988f2372a73be6`) covering exact-scope selection, review-state gating, scope mismatch, effective-date boundaries, overlap and invalid provenance/rates. CI has not yet returned a result for this latest test commit; do not mark it verified until the full workflow passes.
- This is rule-selection groundwork, not a complete tariff calculator and not proof that any specific rate is legally applicable. The next step is CI verification, then source-reviewed rules for specific segments/components and integration with durable per-fill allocation/reconciliation.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Tariff amount calculation and CI checkpoint — 23 October 2026

- Both the tariff registry regression-test commit `74240f2cc0af05befeee1fa97f988f2372a73be6` and its nine-document checkpoint `14fa83fe144228bb81a3b935b48b73c7f454afe2` passed their full Backend tests workflows: [code run 39953794565](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39953794565) and [documentation run 39953906848](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39953906848).
- Added `calculate_tariff_amount` to `backend/app/services/broker_tariff_rules.py`, with distinct `PERCENT`, `INR_PER_CRORE`, and `INR_FIXED` units and paise rounding. Added tests for units, rounding and invalid bases. Latest test commit is `782d2d2c63905adfa6862f43abcdc057c47894a7`; its CI is pending and must be verified before treating the new calculation as green.
- No live tariff rates are activated. The new calculator requires a previously selected approved rule; rule selection still fails closed for missing or overlapping rules. This does not yet integrate the registry with durable per-fill allocation or prove component-specific legal applicability.
- Next: verify CI on the latest code commit, then build reviewed, source-backed test fixtures for exact tariff applicability and connect approved component calculations to durable allocation/reconciliation without enabling ambiguous QUANTITY/NOTIONAL allocation.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Tariff calculation safety refinement — 23 October 2026

- Confirmed prior tariff-calculator code CI passed: [run 39954309954](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39954309954). The prior nine-document checkpoint CI also passed: [run 39954408580](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39954408580).
- Tightened `calculate_tariff_amount` so it refuses non-`TariffRule` values and any rule whose review status is not `APPROVED`. Added regression tests for DRAFT, REVIEWED and REJECTED rules.
- Latest safety-fix test commit: `83a70bdc88dfbc2cfabe8e80b8adfc858b516a6e`. Its full CI is pending; no green status should be inferred yet.
- Active rates remain intentionally absent pending rule-by-rule source verification and approval. Next: verify CI, then implement only specifically sourced rules with explicit applicability, normalized unit, basis, effective date and provenance before connecting to durable per-fill allocation.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Scoped tariff-calculation entry point — 23 October 2026

- Confirmed prior safety-fix code CI passed: [run 39954730200](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39954730200). The previous nine-document checkpoint also passed: [run 39954836920](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39954836920).
- Added `calculate_charge_for_trade` to `backend/app/services/broker_tariff_rules.py` (commit `d2d9c0c99a0cf31bca96fbde39c615b2569b1a97`) to select exactly one approved rule for the full trade scope/date and then calculate using its declared unit. Added tests for calculation result and fail-closed behavior without an approved match (commit `98c514d59d1b1da986a1d00117c2653c1e82d4c6`).
- Latest code CI is pending; do not mark this addition green until full Backend pytest, broker-write boundary, migrations and restore workflow pass.
- This entry point does not persist charge rows or allocate across fills. No production tariff rates are enabled. Next: verify CI, then design a persistence/integration boundary that records the selected rule version and calculation basis alongside the durable source component and per-fill allocation ledger.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Tariff CI verification and estimate/allocation boundary — 23 October 2026

- Verified full Backend CI passed for tariff calculation commit `98c514d59d1b1da986a1d00117c2653c1e82d4c6`: [run 39955151533](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39955151533). Verified the nine-document checkpoint CI passed for `2a5c3cf5075c2ab217603868f6272cc366784b26`: [run 39955284700](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39955284700). Both include pytest, broker-write boundary, SQLite and PostgreSQL migration downgrade/re-upgrade, and isolated synthetic restore steps.
- Added `docs/PHASE3_TARIFF_TO_FILL_ALLOCATION_DESIGN.md` (commit `a49b37509db1658ce7026f8328a35e26422afaad`) to define the boundary between a tariff estimate, actual broker-evidenced source charge and reviewed per-fill allocation; it sets out idempotency, immutable rule snapshots, component-specific acceptance gates and safety constraints.
- Next: CI-check this design/documentation checkpoint, then implement persistence for estimates as a separate, immutable, idempotent record before wiring estimates into source-charge reconciliation. Estimates must never be represented as contract-note actuals or automatically promoted into accounting.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Immutable tariff-estimate snapshot groundwork — 23 October 2026

- Added `backend/app/services/tariff_estimate_snapshot.py` (commit `00ec9fcd449fb9c9c091b29ebc7c68377246242b`) with canonical JSON snapshots, rule/source provenance, SHA-256 fingerprints, explicit calculation base/rounding metadata, stable idempotency keys and exact-replay/conflict comparison.
- Added `backend/tests/test_tariff_estimate_snapshot.py` (commit `f89517a3ca0bc034dc84da6d2239f0fd18026990`) for deterministic serialization, exact replay, conflicting base replay, changed rule, unapproved rules, invalid base, missing identity and effective-date rejection.
- This is a deterministic snapshot and replay-comparison layer only; it does NOT yet persist estimates. Durable enforcement still requires a database table with a unique idempotency constraint, transactional insert/read comparison and a migration tested on SQLite/PostgreSQL. No estimate can become a broker actual or source component.
- Latest code CI must be verified before this work is considered green. Next: confirm test and migration conventions, add durable persistence plus migration, concurrency-safe idempotency, and tests proving rollback/replay behaviour.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Snapshot CI verification and idempotency correction — 23 October 2026

- Verified CI passed for the immutable snapshot implementation `f89517a3ca0bc034dc84da6d2239f0fd18026990`: [code run 39956149855](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39956149855). Verified the associated nine-document checkpoint passed: [run 39956272786](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39956272786). Both runs completed pytest, broker-write boundary, SQLite and PostgreSQL migration downgrade/re-upgrade, and synthetic restore checks successfully.
- Code review identified an idempotency-key flaw: including the tariff rule fingerprint in the key would allow the same trade/component event with a changed rule to receive a new key instead of conflicting. Corrected `tariff_estimate_snapshot.py` so event key is stable across rate/rule changes, and changed the regression test to require a same-event rule change to fail as a conflicting replay.
- Latest correction commits: `204574082c7953ac08262a9f51801f04fd09ead7` and test `fafa26b6fb686471ac38a041256659b273f97712`. CI for this correction is pending.
- The snapshot remains in-memory/canonical only. Durable database persistence is not implemented yet; adding a table/migration requires identifying the current Alembic head and testing a unique idempotency constraint with transactional exact-replay/conflict behavior.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Durable estimate-only tariff persistence — 23 October 2026

- Verified the previous idempotency-correction code CI passed: [run 39956721476](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39956721476). Verified the previous nine-document checkpoint CI passed: [run 39956881266](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39956881266).
- Added `TariffEstimateSnapshotRecord` model and model registration (commits `08fec41026dabf250bd8756e0a711c20bbbf1e2a`, `0f47e07abd8bad51e4a7e11a851c726dd9008882`), Alembic revision `202610240015` after `202610240014` (commit `d98f5e259c610f8a5d392461ea1b75f6b9471912`), and `persist_tariff_estimate_snapshot` (commit `bc8b7bb2666e73cf30aa3fa4a796ebfe4e4874e5`).
- Added persistence regression tests for create/exact replay, changed-base conflict, changed-rule conflict, and estimate-only status (commit `cc121e7c710038ee25a434634a86ec4296cd0d68`). The unique database idempotency key is the concurrency arbiter; the service uses a nested transaction and leaves the outer commit to its caller.
- Latest implementation CI is pending; do not consider durable persistence verified until full pytest, broker-write boundary, SQLite/PostgreSQL migration downgrade/re-upgrade and synthetic restore checks pass.
- The database record stores only estimate snapshot JSON and a digest and has a database constraint that fixes status at `ESTIMATE_ONLY`; it does not create or modify contract-note actual charge/source-component rows.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Persistence CI result and append-only enforcement — 23 October 2026

- Full CI passed for durable estimate persistence implementation commit `cc121e7c710038ee25a434634a86ec4296cd0d68`: [run 39957564616](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39957564616). Backend pytest, broker-write boundary, SQLite and PostgreSQL migration downgrade/re-upgrade, and synthetic restore steps all succeeded.
- Review then identified that the database row had no ORM-level guard against updates to the snapshot payload. Added an append-only SQLAlchemy `before_update` guard to `TariffEstimateSnapshotRecord` (commit `596d4396bfaa58da3f4bf8ad11978370cfc8edf2`) and a regression test proving payload mutation is rejected (commit `af07ad77c3c7621774f49771c5d9cb4665778c03`).
- The append-only guard is an ORM protection, not a database trigger; direct SQL updates outside the ORM are not blocked by this guard. Consider a portable DB-level immutability trigger only if required by the release threat model. The unique key and ESTIMATE_ONLY check remain database-enforced.
- Latest append-only change CI and this documentation checkpoint's CI are pending. Do not treat them as verified until all jobs complete successfully.
- PR #6 remains draft and unmerged pending acceptance gates and explicit user approval. Live broker order writes remain disabled. Only `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved` is in scope; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Phase 3 — tariff snapshot checkpoint (2026-10-23)

Completed in current branch: PostgreSQL/SQLite database-level append-only triggers for tariff estimate snapshots and direct-SQL UPDATE/DELETE regression tests. Exact-head CI run 39959332425 passed.

Remaining: dedicated PostgreSQL persistence race test; explicit conditional/order-scoped tariff rule models and tests; variance-only comparison of approved-rule estimates against reviewed actual contract-note components; final synchronization/verification of all nine core docs. No merge yet; live broker order writes remain disabled.


## Task B checkpoint — verified code tests (2026-10-23)

Completed: database-level snapshot immutability triggers for PostgreSQL/SQLite, direct-SQL mutation/deletion tests, and PostgreSQL concurrent estimate persistence tests for exact replay/conflicting payloads. Code checkpoint `fd0e42917611f3b6c3f826cb2e99971fd3e2cce6` passed CI run 39960409771 (677 passed; broker-write guard; SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips; synthetic restore).

Still required: variance-only estimate-versus-actual comparison with reviewed contract-note components; component-aware conditional/order-level caps, minimums, GST taxable-base composition and special tariff models. Do not promote estimates as actuals. No merge or live order writes.


## Task B variance checkpoint (2026-10-23)

Completed: exact-fill identity in snapshot schema v2; append-only variance record/migration; reviewed actual evidence validation; single-fill-only variance comparison; replay, fail-closed scope, immutability and no-allocation-side-effect tests. CI run 39961777103 passed 680 tests and all safety/migration/restore checks.

Remaining: safe aggregate variance for multi-fill/order-level components and richer conditional/order-level tariff models. No estimate-to-actual promotion; no PR merge or live broker order writes.


## Verified exact PR-head CI 39962196672 — 2026-10-23
Exact PR #6 head `c47bc3e3eeb4c8da4415132735d2d4ef457551f7` passed [CI](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39962196672): 680 passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard passed; no failed steps. Next: (1) design/test aggregate variance scope; (2) support advanced tariff semantics or fail closed; (3) finish accounting integration/replay/conflict/rollback/concurrency review; (4) rerun exact-head CI; (5) sync docs and review all gates before merge consideration. No merge/live writes yet.


## Aggregate variance design milestone — 2026-10-23
Design proposal recorded for exact `ORDER_FILL_SET` variance. Next: audit current schema/services/tests, resolve design differences, implement migration/service only after review, add aggregate/cap/concurrency/replay/conflict/rollback/immutability tests, run exact-head CI, then sync all docs. No aggregate variance support is claimed yet.


## Variance validation fix — 2026-10-23
Implemented canonical manifest-digest validation and estimate-versus-fill side/date matching, with regression tests. Next: verify CI on head `6ca045e2bbdd71d37dd77baf50df3881db2b1e71`; review schema and design for aggregate order/multi-fill variance; implement/test advanced tariff semantics or fail closed; rerun exact-head CI and sync docs. Aggregate variance is not implemented yet.


## Verified code CI — 2026-10-23
Code head `f5092df1d27a28006dccba929fdc41e9a1d63f1e` passed run 39968000009: 683 tests passed, 1 warning; broker-write guard passed; SQLite migration round-trip and isolated PostgreSQL 16 synthetic restore drill completed. Next: (1) verify CI on this documentation checkpoint's resulting head; (2) implement/test aggregate variance; (3) finish advanced tariff semantics or fail-closed rules; (4) run final accounting acceptance and sync docs. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged.


## Aggregate variance implementation checkpoint — 2026-10-23
Implemented explicit fill-set scope, canonical fill-set digest, migration `202610240018`, aggregate variance validation, and regression tests for successful comparison, exact replay, and mismatched manifest. Backend CI run [39979772325](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39979772325) passed on code/test commit `e54e405b74feee90e4658a6992fa208a3e2da5d3`; SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips and broker-write boundary guard passed. Next: exact-head CI for the nine-document synchronization, then review additional concurrency/immutability cases, advanced tariff-rule coverage, and final accounting acceptance. PR remains draft.


## Latest tariff-safety correction checkpoint — 2026-10-23
Tariff guard corrections are on `68dc2b6fa0a729cc77180725e581de61a88e9de1`: GST composition requires an approved GST rule and explicit approved component inputs; stamp-duty SELL requests fail before selection. CI run [39982723294](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39982723294) passed backend pytest, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite/PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and restore drill. Next: verify CI on this documentation commit, then continue the advanced tariff rule coverage/fail-closed audit and final accounting acceptance. PR remains draft.


## Tariff safety + Upstox charge-source research — 2026-10-23

Code commit `ce0b4bc17eaf1656334e10ca8d6e32a68f50593b` adds a fail-closed stamp-duty unit guard: the specialized stamp-duty calculator accepts only percentage-based approved rules; regression tests reject `INR_FIXED` and `INR_PER_CRORE`. Exact-head CI [39987357989](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39987357989) passed backend tests, broker-write boundary guard, SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips, and synthetic restore drill.

Official Upstox sources reviewed:
- Brokerage calculator API: https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-brokerage/ — order-scoped estimate with brokerage, taxes, transaction/clearing/IPFT/SEBI charges and DP-plan metadata; `dp_plan.min_expense` is a daily per-scrip sell minimum outside the brokerage calculation.
- Trade charges API: https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-trade-charges/ — segment/date-range charge breakdown including brokerage, GST, STT, stamp duty, transaction, clearing, IPFT, SEBI turnover and demat transaction charges.
- Historical trades API: https://upstox.com/developer/api-documentation/get-historical-trades/ — trade ID, exchange, segment, quantity, amount, side and trade date.
- Public tariff page: https://upstox.com/brokerage-charges/ — includes historical and newer effective-date rows; never activate rates from a flattened scrape without preserving effective periods and source snapshot.

API charge breakdowns are reconciliation/reference inputs, not automatically contract-note evidence or a substitute for reviewed actual source components. Do not store tokens. DP per-scrip/day minimums, STT/CTT tax-event cases and other conditional models remain unsupported until represented and tested explicitly. No active production tariff registry is enabled. PR #6 stays draft/unmerged; live broker writes remain disabled; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## Generic conditional-charge guard — 2026-10-23
The next audit found that the generic rate calculator could apply plain rate×base arithmetic to STT/CTT and DP/demat components, despite these requiring event- or day/scrip-specific semantics. Commit `ee09183e5b8eeff0311431faa90b807d9b561ce7` adds an explicit fail-closed block for STT, CTT, DP, DP charges and demat/depository transaction charges in the generic calculator, with parameterized regression tests. Exact-head CI run [39988242077](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39988242077) passed. The synchronized documentation commit `b1207def7d828c960e6fffe9c6af8b9ed0177c07` also passed exact-head CI run [39988578238](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/39988578238).

Audit note: the implementation constant is `tariff-estimate-snapshot-v4`; older design text saying snapshot v3 is stale and is corrected in the accompanying design-document update. Remaining gated models include STT/CTT event-specific rules, DP daily per-scrip minimums, conditional lesser-of pricing, and reviewed source-backed effective-date rates. No live tariff registry or live broker order writes are enabled.

## Phase 3 next gate — 2026-10-24
Regression tests cover actual manifest-digest tampering, mixed-order fill sets, side mismatch, and trade-date mismatch. Next: verify CI on the current head; resolve any failures; reconcile remaining aggregate-variance acceptance items (concurrency, reviewed-source revalidation, no allocation/P&L side effects); then verify the nine-document checkpoint. Unsupported tariff rules remain fail-closed and live broker writes disabled.

## Phase 3 next gate — 2026-10-24
Latest verified test head `bc8e5c1aa862589c660fd361d87f7df45d8ceb10` has passing backend CI (run `40062975428`). Next reconcile aggregate variance acceptance: concurrency/replay behavior, reviewed-source revalidation, and explicit no-accounting-side-effect tests. Once that gate is complete, continue durable per-fill charge allocation work. Unsupported tariffs remain fail-closed; live broker writes disabled.

## Phase 3 next gate — 2026-10-24
Latest work adds tests for variance no-side-effects and current review-state revalidation. Next verify exact-head CI, then reconcile concurrent duplicate/replay behavior and finish the aggregate variance acceptance gate before continuing durable per-fill charge allocation follow-up. Keep unsupported tariff rules fail-closed and live broker writes disabled.

## Cross-cutting Upstox task rule — 2026-10-24
Before starting or closing an Upstox feature, read `UPSTOX_API_INTEGRATION_POLICY.md`, check current official docs and SDK coverage, and update the capability matrix. Assess brokerage calculator, historical trade charges, historical trades, market data/WebSocket, options, portfolio and order lifecycle APIs as relevant. Fence off live execution in agent skills; no live order writes. Verify tests and exact-head CI.

## Next Phase 3 gate — 2026-10-24
Aggregate variance concurrency/replay is CI-verified in run `40064129721` on `dbff090610028cfb9f5a87585d9c8e697449cd23` (738 passed, 1 warning). Next: source-backed effective-dated component-specific tariff rules and integration with the durable per-fill ledger. Prioritize brokerage per-order caps/multi-fill handling, GST taxable-base composition, buy-side stamp duty, and segment/product/side/effective-date validation. Explicit-review allocation remains the safe path; unsupported automatic QUANTITY/NOTIONAL and conditional STT/CTT/DP cases remain fail-closed.

## Next Phase 3 task — immutable Upstox estimate snapshots — 2026-10-24
Read-only client methods for brokerage estimate, historical trade-charge aggregate and paginated historical trades passed exact-head CI run `40064514873` (744 passed, 1 warning). Next, normalize the brokerage API response into immutable estimate-only records with exact request parameters, API version, retrieval timestamp and response digest; map components carefully and preserve DP-plan daily minimum as separate metadata. Integrate only with variance-only comparison. Do not create allocation rows or mutate positions/P&L from API estimates or aggregate history.

## Phase 3 next checkpoint — Upstox estimate snapshots (2026-10-24, verified)
The code converts Upstox Brokerage Details responses into six immutable estimate-only component snapshots and retains API request/response provenance, total and DP-plan minimum metadata. Exact input identity and response-digest checks guard variance comparison; no accounting allocation side effects are introduced. Exact-head CI run `40065219626` passed on `2c23ebfeb9d0d843620dc6dcf54b7279bb112662` (**754 passed, 1 warning**). Next: reviewed effective-dated component-specific tariff applicability and safe per-fill integration.

## Next Phase 3 gate — source-backed tariff candidates (2026-10-24)
Flat per-order brokerage (`ORDER_FIXED`/`INR_FIXED`) is now supported alongside capped percentage order brokerage; exact-head CI run `40065607232` passed (**756 passed, 1 warning**). No rates are activated. Next: archive current official Upstox/NSE source excerpts with reproducible digests, add candidate effective-dated rules in DRAFT state, and test exact applicability/effective-date boundaries before approval.

## Next Phase 3 gate — tariff candidate review (2026-10-24, verified)
A dated normalized Upstox/NSE charge excerpt and 18 effective-dated STT/exchange-charge candidates are committed; all remain DRAFT and unselectable. Exact-head CI run `40065979244` passed (**760 passed, 1 warning**). Next: archive original source bytes where possible, corroborate stamp duty, resolve IPFT/transaction-charge semantics, and add applicability/effective-date tests before approval or automatic allocation.


## Fixed-order brokerage entrypoint regression — 24 October 2026

- Audit found that `calculate_charge_for_trade` routed percentage-based `ORDER_NOTIONAL` brokerage through `calculate_order_brokerage`, but flat-fee `ORDER_FIXED` brokerage fell through to the generic calculator, which intentionally rejects that basis.
- Fixed the shared entry point to route both `ORDER_NOTIONAL` and `ORDER_FIXED` brokerage through the guarded order-level calculator. Added regression test `test_trade_charge_entrypoint_supports_flat_fixed_order_brokerage` asserting a flat INR 20 fee is returned through the full scope-selection entry point.
- Implementation commit: `1634989d29734f1d5ffdcfee826384a512eaafe7`; regression-test commit: `928c0207ff8de5f4852225ab6b9e0fabe97f6e12`.
- Exact-head backend CI run 40066706304 was in progress at documentation time; do not mark this fix green until that run completes. Recheck CI after these documentation updates because they change the branch head.
- No tariff candidate was activated, no charge was promoted to the actual ledger, and no live broker order was sent. Original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## Brokerage basis/unit validation hardening — 24 October 2026

- Latest verified prior head: Backend pytest workflow run [40066838844](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40066838844) passed for the flat fixed-order brokerage entry-point regression.
- Additional fail-closed hardening now rejects inconsistent brokerage rule shapes at construction: `ORDER_FIXED` requires `INR_FIXED`, and `ORDER_NOTIONAL` requires `PERCENT`. This prevents invalid basis/unit combinations from surviving registry validation and failing only during calculation.
- Implementation commit: `4faa6a062264b2396cb00e380c5cbbe16449ec91`; regression-test commit: `26ea299b78be463651768b2ab93fa6443d5350c5`.
- CI for these new commits is pending and must be checked on the exact latest branch head before this change is considered verified. Do not reuse the earlier green run as evidence for these commits.
- No official tariff rate was activated, no estimate was promoted to actual per-fill accounting, and no live broker order was sent. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`, not the original `Tradepro` repository.


## Brokerage rule validation CI correction — 24 October 2026

- Backend CI run [40067041722](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40067041722) failed with 2 tests failing and 762 passing. The failure exposed that generic rate-unit arithmetic tests used a default `brokerage/ORDER_NOTIONAL` rule while intentionally testing `INR_PER_CRORE` and `INR_FIXED`; the new brokerage shape guard correctly rejected those inconsistent test fixtures.
- Corrected the generic unit test matrix to use semantically appropriate component/basis pairs: `brokerage/ORDER_NOTIONAL/PERCENT`, `sebi_turnover/TURNOVER/INR_PER_CRORE`, and `other_fee/ORDER_FIXED/INR_FIXED`. This preserves the guard rather than weakening production validation.
- Test-fix commit: `6ba333fe0339838042ffd25a141c4805318418bc`. A new CI result for this exact commit has not yet been observed; do not mark it green until confirmed.
- No tariff rules were activated and no charge allocations or live broker orders were created. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro` remains out of scope.


## Generic tariff test basis correction — 24 October 2026

- Backend CI run [40067217326](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40067217326) completed with 763 passed and 1 failed. The remaining failure was the generic unit-arithmetic test using `ORDER_FIXED`, which is intentionally excluded from generic calculation bases and must use the specialized brokerage entry point.
- Corrected the test fixture to use supported generic basis `NOTIONAL` for the generic `INR_FIXED` arithmetic case. The production guard is unchanged. Test correction commit: `7c7dadff65885918fc0e01d0aa8deaf1b6d1bb16`.
- CI for this correction and subsequent documentation updates must be checked on the exact latest PR head. No green result is claimed until verified.
- No tariffs were activated; no actual charges were promoted or per-fill ledger writes made; no live broker orders were sent. PR #6 remains draft and unmerged. Work is limited to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; original `Tradepro` remains untouched.


## Official tariff-source recheck — 24 October 2026

- Rechecked the official Upstox charges page on 2026-10-24 and recorded the findings in `docs/UPSTOX_CHARGE_RULE_SOURCE_REGISTER.md`. It lists 1 April 2026 STT/CTT changes and 1 March 2026 NSE transaction-charge changes, and states IPFT is combined with transaction charges while separately listing ₹0.01/crore (options on premium) plus GST. Current candidate rows represent transaction charges only; IPFT composition/effective-date treatment must be resolved before approval.
- The same page's ₹10/order API-order brokerage note is explicitly valid only through 31 December 2025 (excluding GTT); do not treat it as current pricing. Current authenticated API-order-specific terms remain unverified.
- NSE's official stamp-duty page is still marked updated 03/10/2023, so it is not a fresh 2026 publication. Independent current statutory corroboration remains a release gate.
- No tariff candidate was approved or activated, no estimate was promoted to actual per-fill accounting, and no live broker order was sent. Source excerpt remains normalized rather than byte-for-byte HTML. Exact-head CI must be checked after these documentation changes; prior green CI does not cover the new head.


## Brokerage tariff effective-date gate — 24 October 2026

- Reconfirmed the official Upstox public page lists current brokerage examples: equity delivery/options ₹20 per executed order; equity intraday ₹20 or 0.1% (whichever lower); equity futures ₹20 or 0.05% (whichever lower). The current source excerpt does not establish a precise effective_from date for these brokerage terms.
- A trial draft-registry addition was reverted because populating the required `effective_from` with the retrieval date would falsely imply a published effective date. No brokerage candidates with guessed effective dates remain in the tariff registry. Before registering these rows, obtain a source that establishes the effective date or explicitly model an evidence-backed “current as observed” rule state without pretending the retrieval date is the tariff effective date.
- Existing calculation helpers can model flat per-order brokerage and capped percentage brokerage (`maximum_inr`), but helper capability is not source approval. The published “whichever lower” semantics must have a regression test before a reviewed rule is eligible for use.
- The preceding verified Backend pytest run was [40067742361](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40067742361), successful on the then-current head. Later registry/documentation commits need exact-head CI confirmation; do not reuse that run as proof for later commits.
- No rates were activated, no estimates were promoted into actual accounting, and no live broker order was sent. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged and the original `Tradepro` repository remains out of scope.


## Order-brokerage cap regression coverage — 24 October 2026

- Added regression coverage for percentage brokerage below/at the maximum cap, minimum-floor behavior, simultaneous minimum/maximum bounds, and flat `ORDER_FIXED/INR_FIXED` brokerage. Tests call the specialized order-level calculation helper and assert paise-precise outputs; flat order fees reject percentage caps.
- Test commit: `48447dafb11d7d83a09f4f64a55020405fa167a4`. This is not yet CI-verified; run and inspect CI for the exact latest PR head before treating the tests as passing.
- This covers arithmetic only. It does not approve any live tariff row, define the allocation of one order's brokerage across multiple fills, or establish that public examples match a particular authenticated account plan. Per-fill allocation and actual-charge promotion remain blocked pending policy/evidence and durable accounting acceptance tests.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged; no live broker orders were sent; original `Tradepro` remains out of scope.

## CI follow-up — fixed-fee cap regression test — 24 October 2026

- Latest documentation head before this correction, `5b155c4b3f75606b426262f938b420f7a2217d74`, failed backend pytest: **768 passed, 1 failed**. Failure was isolated to `test_fixed_order_brokerage_is_flat_and_rejects_caps`: the test expected calculation-time rejection, but `TariffRule` correctly rejects an invalid fixed-fee rule at construction time.
- Corrected the regression test to assert the rule-construction `ValueError` using the actual validation message. Test-only commit: [47aa91e2696bb6388af73ede568dfe89c4cbead7](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/47aa91e2696bb6388af73ede568dfe89c4cbead7).
- CI for this correction and the resulting documentation head is **pending verification**; do not describe the latest head as green until the exact SHA has a successful run. This is a test correction, not a production guard relaxation.
- PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order submission remains disabled. All work is confined to `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; do not modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.

## Exact-head CI passed — 24 October 2026

- Verified successful GitHub Actions backend workflow [40081403001](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/actions/runs/40081403001) against exact head `ff9675f5489f4148079b3ee7cd4a97810e352b4b`: **769 passed, 1 warning in 44.10s**. Broker-write boundary guard passed; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 migration round-trips passed; synthetic PostgreSQL/document-volume restore drill passed and evidence artifact was uploaded.
- The preceding test-only correction [47aa91e](https://github.com/tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved/commit/47aa91e2696bb6388af73ede568dfe89c4cbead7) asserts that a fixed-fee tariff rule with a maximum cap is rejected at rule construction. This does not weaken production validation.
- The single pytest warning is a Starlette/AnyIO deprecation warning. GitHub Actions also logged Node.js 20 action-runtime deprecation warnings. These did not fail the run.
- Aggregate `ORDER_FILL_SET` variance tests and the variance-only persistence service are present; this successful suite includes their tests. Variance records remain audit-only and do not promote charges or create per-fill allocations. Source-backed effective tariff applicability, charge composition, and durable accounting acceptance remain open gates.
- Synthetic restore is not actual Oracle Cloud recovery. PR #6 remains draft/unmerged. Live broker order execution and automatic accounting promotion remain disabled. All work stays in `tarunsharma2610-del/tradepro-improved`; never modify original `tarunsharma2610-del/Tradepro`.
